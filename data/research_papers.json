Our approach uses pairwise L\u00e9vy-area and cross-correlation of returns to rank the assets from leaders to followers. We use the rankings to construct a portfolio that longs or shorts the followers based on the previous returns of the leaders, and the stocks are ranked every time the portfolio is rebalanced. The portfolio also takes an offsetting position on the SPY ETF so that the initial value of the portfolio is zero. Our data spans from 1963 to 2022, and we use an average of over 500 stocks to construct portfolios for each trading day. The annualized returns of our lead-lag portfolios are over 20 %, and the returns outperform all lead-lag benchmarks in the literature. There is little overlap between the leaders and the followers we find and those that are reported in previous studies based on market capitalization, volume traded, and intra-industry relationships. Our findings support the slow information diffusion hypothesis; i.e., portfolios rebalanced once a day consistently outperform the bidiurnal, weekly, bi-weekly, tri-weekly, and monthly rebalanced portfolios.

This relationship between stock prices is often referred to as a lead-lag relationship. Detecting lead-lag relationships among a large set of stocks is not straightforward. The extant literature uses ad-hoc methods to select leaders and followers, and employs these two sets of stocks in investment strategies to evaluate the economic significance of the lead-lag relationship. For example, Lo and MacKinlay (1990) assume that large market capitalization stocks lead small market capitalization stocks. They build equal-weighted portfolios within each quantile of market capitalizations and use the cross-autocorrelation between the five portfolios to evaluate the trading performance of the lead-lag relationship. Empirical evidence suggests that firm size (Lo and MacKinlay (1990)), trading volume (Chordia and Swaminathan (2000)), institutional ownership (Badrinath et al. (1995)), and other firm characteristics contribute to the lead-lag identity of a stock. Empirically, however, many lead-lag relationships change over time and often cannot be explained by sorting stocks on a single firm characteristic.7This observation motivates that it is necessary to detect, instead of assume and then verify, lead-lag relationships. Our objective is to find lead-lag relationships without explicitly assuming a link between firm characteristics and lead-lag relationships; instead, we develop a data-driven method that employs stock returns to identify leaders and followers, and we show that the lead-lag relationships we find are economically significant. We achieve this in three steps. First, we design an algorithm that identifies the direction and strength of the lead-lag relationship between the returns of two stocks. Second, we propose a framework that uses state-of-the-art algorithms to rank stocks from leaders to followers based on the pairwise relationships. Third, we construct a zero-cost portfolio to assess the returns predictability of the leaders over the followers, and we measure the economic significance of the portfolio\u2019s performance. Specifically, in the first step we design a method to score the lead-lag relationship between pairs of assets. The sign of the score indicates which of the two assets is more likely the leader, and the magnitude of the score quantifies the strength of the lead-lag relationship.",

        "content": "We compute the pairwise score for all combinations of asset pairs, and use the pairwise scores to construct a skew-symmetric matrix, which we refer to as the lead-lag matrix. In this paper, we introduce three scoring methods. Two methods use cross-correlations to capture linear lead-lag relationships; and the third is based on the L\u00e9vy-area of pairwise asset returns, which captures both linear and nonlinear lead-lag relationships. In the second step, we use the lead-lag matrix to sort the stocks from \"most likely to be a leader\" to \"most likely to be a follower\". First, we compute the mean of each column of the skew-symmetric lead-lag matrix and order the columns according to their mean, from highest to lowest. A priori, stocks in columns with high means are more likely to be leaders, and those in columns with low means are more likely to be followers. Finally, after identifying a set of leaders and a set of followers, we use the sign of the previous return of the set of leaders as a signal to buy or to sell an equal-weighted portfolio of the followers. The portfolio is financed by taking an offsetting position on the SPY ETF to finance the portfolio, so the value of the portfolio at inception is zero. We rank the 7See Appendix A for motivating examples. 2stocks and rebalance the portfolio every day, and compare the portfolio\u2019s performance with those of the lead-lag-based portfolios proposed in Lo and MacKinlay (1990), Chordia and Swaminathan (2000), and Hou (2007). For robustness and comparisons, we also study portfolios that are rebalanced at bidiurnal, weekly, bi-weekly, tri-weekly, and monthly frequencies \u2014 stocks are ranked at the same frequency as that of the the portfolio rebalances. In line with the extant literature, our study uses the profitability of the lead-lag portfolio to evaluate the economic significance of the lead-lag relationship between pairs and between groups of stocks. The profitability of the portfolio has two advantages as an evaluation metric. One, portfolio profitability provides a direct comparison with the existing literature. Two, as suggested by Kelly et al. (2022), directly considering portfolio performance is more suitable than using the R2of a linear regression. A portfolio can generate significant economic profits even if the predicted R2of a regression on returns is negative because the variance of forecasts can heavily influence the predicted R2. We use data from 1963 to 2022 to compare the performance of our lead-lag portfolios with those of the portfolios built with the lead-lag relationships identified in the literature. We use only the stocks with large market capitalization to ensure that our portfolios are tradable. Specifically, in each trading day, our analysis includes approximately 550 stocks which are the top 25% largest stocks by market capitalization in NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX. Our results show that the portfolios based on the lead-lag relationships we detect outperform those proposed in the extant literature that are based on market capitalization, trading volume, or sector identity. Specifically, the lead-lag relationships we detect lead to portfolios with annualized returns of over 20 %and Sharpe ratios above 2. The annualized return and Sharpe ratio of our portfolios are, respectively, three times and approximately twice those of the portfolios proposed in the extant literature. The performance of our portfolios is robust to various choices of parameter values, ranking algorithms, and selection of sets of tradable stocks. In particular, we find that the identity of a stock as a leader or follower changes frequently over time. A lead-lag relationship found at any particular time window rarely remains profitable after 6 months. Our results are economically significant after accounting for industry standard transaction costs and trading frictions. The return of our portfolios cannot be explained by the Fama\u2013French risk factors, illiquidity of stocks, or lead-lag relationships proposed in the literature. In particular, there is little overlap between the leaders and the followers that we identify and those identified by the literature; thus, our method detects fundamentally different lead-lag relationships from those identified in the literature. In addition, we study one source of lead-lag relationships in stock prices.",

        "content": "The literature suggests that asynchronous reactions in stock prices to common information cause the lead-lag relationships; they refer to this conjecture as the hypothesis of slow information diffusion.8The sluggishness in reaction to common information depends on various features, including relatively small firm size (Lo and MacKinlay (1990)), relatively low trading volume (Chordia and Swaminathan (2000)), relatively low institutional ownership (Badrinath et al. (1995)), and many other types of market features.9 8Lo and MacKinlay (1990), Brennan et al. (1993), and Badrinath et al. (1995) argue that lead-lag effects exist because some firms react more slowly to common information than others; Hou (2007) is the earliest paper we found that explicitly calls this the \"slow information diffusion hypothesis\". 9The literature proposes the \"limited investor attention\" hypothesis to explain why some stocks take longer than others to react to common information. 3Our results lend strong support to the slow information diffusion hypothesis. We perform a temporal analysis of our lead-lag portfolios to study the speed of information diffusion. If the slow information diffusion hypothesis is valid, then the economic significance of the lead-lag relationships we identify would gradually diminish as the time gap between identifying the lead-lag relationship and executing the trades to build the portfolio increases. In our study, we vary the rebalancing frequency of the lead-lag portfolios and the frequency of detecting lead-lag relationships from daily to bidiurnal, weekly, bi-weekly, tri-weekly, and monthly. Our results show that as the rebalancing frequency decreases, the performance of the lead-lag portfolios decreases. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the performance of the portfolios with daily rebalancing is indistinguishable from that of the portfolios rebalanced at slower frequencies. However, over time, the daily portfolio gradually outperforms the monthly portfolio, and then the tri-weekly, the bi-weekly, and the weekly rebalanced portfolios from the late 1970s onward. Our findings contribute to the literature on return predictability, specifically the strand that explores lead-lag relationships among stocks. After Lo and MacKinlay (1990), there has been a growing literature on the lead-lag relationships between two portfolios of stocks. In contrast to our approach, the extant literature does not develop methods to detect which stocks are leaders and which are followers; instead, it assumes which stocks lead and which follow, and uses portfolios to evaluate the lead-lag relationships. Badrinath et al. (1995) study the lead-lag relationship between groups of stocks with higher institutional ownership (i.e., leaders) and lower institutional ownership (i.e., followers), while Chordia and Swaminathan (2000) study the lead-lag relationship where groups of stocks with larger trading volume lead stocks with smaller trading volume. Brennan et al. (1993) verify that stocks with higher investment analyst coverage lead those with lower coverage. Hou (2007) shows lead-lag relationships between large and small market capitalization stocks within each industry, while Frazzini and Cohen (2008) and Menzly and Ozbas (2009) assume lead-lag relationships between groups of stocks with economic links specified by consumer-supplier relationships from financial reports data. More recently, Parsons et al. (2020) assume lead-lag relationships between groups of stocks from different sectors that are co-headquartered, and Huang et al. (2022) show that stocks with frequent, gradual price updates tend to lead those with infrequent, sharp price updates. We also contribute to a more general literature that uses the cross-section of stock returns to predict asset price movements. For example, DeMiguel et al. (2014) build a vector autoregression (V AR) model that regresses asset returns on the cross-section of previous returns of all other stocks and build arbitrage portfolios. Kelly et al. (2023) provide a theoretical framework on building optimal portfolios based on the cross-section of stock returns, and Yan and Yu (2023) study cross-stock momentum portfolios based on the framework. We contribute to this literature by introducing a framework to rank stocks and then use the returns of the high-ranked stocks to predict the returns of the low-ranked stocks. In contrast to the strand of finance literature on lead-lag relationships, the literature in network science and graph-based machine learning develops data-driven methods to detect lead-lag relationships and applies them to networks of financial assets. For example, Bennett et al. (2022) use clustering algorithms to classify stocks into several groups and study lead-lag relationships between the stock groups. Li et al.",

(2023) and Zhang et al. (2023). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed methodology is the first data-driven method in the finance literature designed to detect lead-lag relationships and to verify the slow information diffusion hypothesis in stock returns on daily or slower frequencies. However, several other lines of work explore lead-lag relationship detection for time series in fields such as statistics, econometrics, and machine learning. We fill the gap in this literature by designing a data-driven method customized to financial time series. A well-known parametric method in econometrics to detect lead-lag relationships is the Granger Causality test, Granger (1969). Scherbina and Schlusche (2018) use this method to test return lead-lag pairs among individual stocks, and prove pairwise return predictability upon news release, while Basnarkov et al. (2020) use this method to test for lead-lag relationships in foreign exchange markets. Similarly, although not designed for lead-lag relationships, the Sargan\u2013Hansen test can be used to test lead-lag relationships when the link is considered as an instrumental causal relationship, see Sargan (1958). This strand of the literature assumes a linear relationship between the leaders and the followers. While studies in the lead-lag literature assume linear relationships between leaders and followers, studies in other strands of finance suggest that nonlinear relationships should be considered. Works such as Campbell and Cochrane (1995); Bansal and Yaron (2004); He and Krishnamurthy (2013); DeMiguel et al. (2021), uncover nonlinear relationships in asset returns across various markets, frequencies, and asset classes; in particular, Pohl et al. (2018) suggest that linear approximations to nonlinear models can lead to considerable errors in the model predictions of asset returns. DeMiguel et al. (2021) also show that by accounting for nonlinearity, investors can construct portfolios of funds that incur positive alpha whereas linear methods incur near-zero alpha. Altogether, these works illustrate the need to account for nonlinearity in lead-lag relationships. Our approach is fundamentally different from previous methods in econometrics because we do not assume a linear relationship between the time series of returns, and because our model captures nonlinear dependencies that can be parameterized by piecewise continuous functions. We use the L\u00e9vy-area between each pair of stock returns to find nonlinear lead-lag relationships. We derive that, under mild assumptions, when the return of one stock is modeled as a continuous function of the previous return of another stock, the L\u00e9vy-area between the returns of these two stocks reflects the direction and strength of the lead-lag relationship between them. For more detail on L\u00e9vy-area in machine learning, data streams, and quantitative finance, see Lyons (2014); Gyurk\u00f3 et al. (2013); Chevyrev and Kormilitzin (2016). To the best of our knowledge, the work of Bennett et al. (2022) is the only predecessor that uses L\u00e9vy-area of stock return time series for lead-lag relationships; specifically, it applies L\u00e9vy-area and Hermitian clustering (Cucuringu et al. (2019)) to form clusters of leaders and followers, and explores network effects and predictability among the clusters 10Some other works use methods in network science to build graphs with intra-day data and inspect lead-lag relationships, see Chester Curme and Kenett (2015), Basnarkov et al. (2020), and Buccheri et al. (2019). 5they construct. Different from our work, Bennett et al. (2022) do not build on the slow information diffusion hypothesis and do not rank individual stocks from leaders to followers. In the machine learning and statistics literature, there are data-driven methods for time series lead-lag detection. One of the most common and intuitive methods is to compute lagged correlation or cross-correlation between pairs of time series. Cross-correlation is a class of lagged correlation coefficients between two time series. Numerous works in finance use this method. For example, Chan (1992) studies intra-day lead-lag relationships between the cash market and stock index futures market. In the computer science literature, Sakurai et al.",

For univariate regression models, the R2value of a regression is equivalent to the square of the correlation coefficient between the dependent variable and the independent variable after normalizing the variables. Therefore, using cross-correlation as lead-lag detection method is equivalent to conducting univariate linear regressions and using R2as a measurement criterion of lead-lag relationships. On the other hand, works including those of Badrinath et al. (1995); Chordia and Swaminathan (2000); Hou (2007); Frazzini and Cohen (2008); Menzly and Ozbas (2009) use the R2of the Granger causality test to verify the direction of the lead-lag relationships they study. While it is easier to establish statistical significance with the Granger causality test, directly using cross-correlation better aligns with the scope of this paper because we do not assume the direction of lead-lag relationships and we wish to explore the dynamics of lead-lag relationships. Another popular method for lead-lag detection is the spectral method in Hause (1971). If two time series are related by a lead-lag relationship, then the cross-spectral density function will exhibit a peak at a certain frequency corresponding to the lag between the two series. This method is most useful when the time series are driven by cyclical or periodic patterns. However, in finance, the spectral method is less useful and not frequently employed for lead-lag detection because stock returns exhibit more complex and often nonlinear relationships. Finally, in our study of the slow information diffusion hypothesis, we are the first to study lead-lag relationships across various sampling frequencies. Most papers study lead-lag relationships at a monthly frequency (Badrinath et al. (1995), Menzly and Ozbas (2009), Frazzini and Cohen (2008), Parsons et al. (2020), Huang et al. (2022)), and others study weekly lead-lag relationships (Lo and MacKinlay (1990), Chordia and Swaminathan (2000), Hou (2007)). Few papers study daily lead-lag relationships, e.g., Badrinath et al. (1995), Brennan et al. (1993), and Chordia and Swaminathan (2000). Hou (2007) argues that daily data may induce problems caused by non-synchronous updates of price information, which is mainly caused by the low liquidity of some stocks. In our study, we only use relatively large market capitalization stocks; therefore, we minimize instances of non-synchronous price updates. The scarcity of studies employing daily data may be attributed to the prevalence of previous research that employs firm characteristics, which are available only at weekly or monthly intervals. With our approach, one can investigate frequencies from daily to monthly because our method only requires asset prices, which are available at much higher frequencies than that of firm characteristics data. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the mathematical setup to identify lead-lag relationships and provides the main mathematical models we use. Section 3 describes the data and discusses results. 6Section 4 provides robustness checks and considers alternative specifications of numerical experiments. Section 5 concludes and the appendix collects proofs and results. 2 Mathematical Model and Problem Setting Here, we identify and verify lead-lag relationships in a set of stocks in two steps: identify potential leaders and followers, and construct a lead-lag portfolio to verify the lead-lag relationship. 2.1 Identifying pairwise lead-lag relationships For each asset n, and for each time t= 1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, T, we standardize the asset returns at time tso that their mean and standard deviation are zero and one, respectively, over the rolling window from t\u221230tot. The standardized returns are denoted by \u02dcRn,t, where n\u22081,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, Nt. Here, Ntdenotes the number of tradable stocks at time t, and the units oftcan vary from a day to a month. At each time t, we aim to identify a set of leaders nt land a set of followers nt f, such that the returns of the leaders at time t\u2212\u2113are employed to predict the returns of the followers at time t; here, \u2113is a positive integer with the same units as those of t. To demonstrate that the returns of leader stocks predict the returns of follower stocks, we first consider the linear model \u02dcRp,t=\u03b2\u2113\u02dcRq,t\u2212\u2113+\u03f5t. (1) Here, \u03b2\u2113is the coefficient of the lead-lag relationship where asset qwith previous standardized return \u02dcRq,t\u2212\u2113is used to predict the standardized return \u02dcRp,tof asset p, and \u03f5tis random noise.",

        "content": "A sufficient condition for the leader stocks to predict follower stocks is that the coefficient \u03b2\u2113in the regression analysis is statistically significant. We use this regression model as a baseline because \u03b2\u2113is the Pearson correlation between the standardized returns \u02dcRp,tand\u02dcRq,t\u2212\u2113. We develop a framework for lead-lag detection methods that uses pairwise lead-lag relationships to rank a set of assets from \"most likely to be a leader\" to \"most likely to be a follower\". First, consider a pairwise lead-lag detection method that determines which of the two assets pandqis \"more-likely\" the leader and which is \"more-likely\" the follower. The method scores each asset pair p, qto obtain at least one of the following: (i)the direction of the lead-lag relationship through the sign of the score, and (ii)the magnitude of the score to determine the strength of the lead-lag relationship. At each time t, we compute all pairwise scores and construct an NtbyNtlead-lag matrix Ctwhere the i, jentry is the pairwise lead-lag score for asset iand asset j. Next, we employ four algorithms on the lead-lag matrix Ctto rank the assets from most likely to be a leader to most likely to be a follower. In the body of this paper, we use the column averages of the lead-lag matrix Ctto rank the stocks; recall that each stock is represented by a column in the matrix. High mean values of columns in Ctare associated with leaders, and low mean values of columns are associated with followers. From the perspective of the slow information diffusion hypothesis, stocks with high column mean values are those for which information arrives sooner, and the stocks with 7low mean values are those that react slower to information. Appendix D introduces three alternative ranking methods we use in our robustness analysis. Our framework encompasses the approach used by the benchmarks we employ. For example, to cast Lo and MacKinlay (1990) in our framework, we use the difference in the market capitalization of two companies as lead-lag score, i.e., the entries of the lead-lag matrix Ct, and to rank companies by the column average of the lead-lag matrix Ct. Here, we describe our lead-lag detection methods and show that they fit into the above framework to identify leaders and followers. First, consider two correlation-based methods for which we define their lead-lag scores as operators on the vector space of standardized asset returns C1(\u02dcRp,t,\u02dcRq,t) = arg max \u2113\u2208[\u2212T,T]Corr (\u02dcRp,t,\u02dcRq,t\u2212\u2113), (2) C2(\u02dcRp,t,\u02dcRq,t) =\u00b11 Tmax\uf8f1 \uf8f2 \uf8f3X \u2113\u2208[\u2212T,0]Corr (\u02dcRp,t,\u02dcRq,t\u2212\u2113),X \u2113\u2208[0,T]Corr (\u02dcRp,t,\u02dcRq,t\u2212\u2113)\uf8fc \uf8fd \uf8fe. (3) Here, Corr (\u02dcRp,t,\u02dcRq,t\u2212\u2113)is the Pearson correlation between the returns \u02dcRp,tand\u02dcRq,t\u2212\u2113. Recall that \u02dcRp,tdenotes standardized returns, so their mean is zero and their variance is one; therefore, the sign of the score C2determines the direction of the lead-lag relationship and the magnitude of C2quantifies the strength of the lead-lag relationship; on the other hand, it is only guaranteed that the sign of the score C1determines the direction of the lead-lag relationship. However, C1performs equally well as C2on simulated data because when asset pleads many other assets, the value of P qC1(\u02dcRp,t,\u02dcRq,t)will be large and vice versa. When computing C1, many of the components in the resulting lead-lag matrixCwill be zero; therefore, C1provides a sparser alternative to C2when we construct the lead-lag matrix C, which makes C1more storage space efficient than C2. Next, we use the concept of L\u00e9vy-area to detect lead-lag relationships in linear models, e.g., (1), and when there are nonlinear and higher-order lead-lag relationships between the leader and the follower. The concept of L\u00e9vy-area is linked to Signatures from rough path theory (see Appendix B for more details). For a two-dimensional random process Xt= (Xi t, Xj t), consider its coordinate iterated integrals over a time interval (s, t), defined as S(X)i,j s,t=Z s<a<tS(X)i s,adXj a =Z s<a<tZ s<b<adXi bdXj a,(4) which we use to compute the L\u00e9vy-area AL\u00b4evy i,j=1 2(S(X)i,j s,t\u2212S(X)j,i s,t) (5) 8between Xi tandXj t. We show, under mild assumptions, that the L\u00e9vy-area between normalized returns \u02dcRn,tand\u02dcRm,t can detect lead-lag relationships for the more complex model \u02dcRn,t=\u03b2\u2113f(\u02dcRm,t\u2212\u2113) +\u03f5t.",

For the leading time series {xt}and the following time series {f(xt\u22121)}, both of length 500, C1andC2correctly identify which one is the leader with an accuracy of 63.1%and52.5%, respectively, in 50000 Monte Carlo simulations; in contrast, L\u00e9vy-area correctly identifies the lead-lag relationship with an accuracy of 94.5%. The above theorem shows that one can identify both linear and nonlinear pairwise lead-lag relationships using the L\u00e9vy-area between each pair of stocks. Despite the L\u00e9vy-area method is only applicable to lags of size 1, one can use multi-step standardized returns instead of one-step standardized returns to circumvent this constraint, thus one can re-scale multi-step standardized returns to set the lag \u2113to 1 and focus on one-step lead-lag relationships. The approach of fixing the lag size is standard in the literature, e.g., Lo and MacKinlay (1990) consider only fixed lag sizes, where the lag size does not change across all pairs of leaders and followers. In addition, the efficacy of the L\u00e9vy-area to quantify the strength of the lead-lag relationship depends on the behavior of the function fand the standardized returns of the assets. Specifically, because the returns are standardized to have mean zero, if the third derivative of fis relatively small over the unit disc, then the L\u00e9vy-area provides an accurate estimate of the lead-lag strength between the two stocks. 11Formally, fis any member of C\u221e(Rn), which is the Banach space with infinity norm of all continuous functions defined on the space of n-dimensional real vectors. 12The leading time series xtis generated from a normal distribution with mean 0and standard deviation 1, and the following time series f(xt\u22121)is linked to xtthrough the function f(xt) =10 1+exp ( \u2212xt)+5 1+exp (10 xt)\u22127.5. 90 100 200 300 400 50015 10 5 051015follower leaderFigure 1: An example of a leading time series and a following time series that cannot be detected by linear methods. 2.2 Constructing Lead-lag portfolios After sorting the assets from most likely to be a leader to most likely to be a follower, we use the raw returns of the leaders to predict the raw returns of the followers, and we construct a portfolio to evaluate the economic significance of the lead-lag relationship. Consider models (1)and(6), our portfolio compares the predictive power of the leaders on the whole US equity market with the predictive power of the leaders on the followers to assess if there is a significant lead-lag relationship between the leaders and the followers. At each time t, assume the top mstocks represent the set of leaders nt land the bottom nstocks represent the set of followers nt fin the sorting, the raw returns of the mstocks at timet\u2212\u2113should provide an indication of the raw returns of the nstocks at time t. In this section, we set the lag \u2113 to 1 day, see Theorem 1.",

        "content": "Furthermore, because we expect the predictability of the mleaders on the nfollowers to be stronger than that of the mleaders on the US equity market, the sign of the raw returns of the mleaders at time t\u2212\u2113 should be, statistically, the same as the sign of the difference between the raw return of the nfollower stocks and the market return Rmkt. Based on the above intuition, we build a portfolio to evaluate if the lead-lag relationship we detect is economically significant; see Algorithm 1 and Figure 2a. The algorithm uses the previous raw returns of the leaders as a signal to construct an equal-weight portfolio with the followers. Here, RLeader t\u22121 andRFollower t are the average raw returns of an equal-weighted portfolio with the leaders and the portfolio of the followers at time t\u22121andt, respectively. When the average of the raw returns of the leaders is positive, the algorithm buys the followers, and when the average of the raw returns of the portfolio of leaders is negative, the algorithm sells the followers. In step 3 of the algorithm, one trades the market to finance the portfolio. For example, when the average of the raw returns of the leaders is negative at time t, one short sells the followers and buys the market at time t+ 1. Therefore, one way of interpreting the performance of the portfolio is by how much more the leaders predict the followers than they predict the US equity market. 10Algorithm 1 Constructing a lead-lag portfolio Input: Raw asset returns R1,1:t,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, RN,1:t, Raw market return Rmkt,1:t Parameter : Look-back window w, number of leaders m, number of followers n;m+n\u2264N while t\u2265wdo 1.

For example, if at time tthe average of the raw return of the portfolio of leaders is negative, one short sells the followers and buys the leaders at time t+ 1. This alternative approach assumes that the predictability of the leader on the follower is greater than the autocorrelation of the leader. Compared with this alternative, our approach offers two primary advantages. First, the performance of our portfolio is interpretable; it measures the ability of the portfolio of leaders to predict the portfolio of followers instead of predicting the market. Second, it is more feasible to trade exchange-traded funds such as the SPY to finance the lead-lag portfolio. In particular, when short selling, it is more feasible to short sell the SPY ETF than an entire portfolio of leaders. In the context of financial time series; our approach to consider the performance of the portfolio is more suitable than those in the literature that apply linear regression models and observe R2values because the variance of forecasts can heavily influence the predictive R2, see Kelly et al. (2022). Some studies use characteristics including firm sector or the location of a firm\u2019s headquarter to group stocks into blocks. Next, they sort the stocks into leaders and followers within each of these blocks and construct lead-lag portfolios within each block of stocks as above, see, e.g., Hou (2007). To compare our approach with those in the papers that classify stocks into groups, we extend our methodology to include data-driven algorithms that partition stocks into groups. Specifically, we use state-of-the-art data-driven clustering algorithms, including spectral clustering (Ng et al. (2001)) and Hermitian clustering (Cucuringu et al. (2019)) that use information in the lead-lag matrix Cto group stocks. Financially, these algorithms rearrange assets into groups via pairwise characteristics. We apply these clustering algorithms to the skew-symmetric lead-lag matrix Cobtained with Algorithm 1, and employ the resulting clusters to construct our portfolios.",

See Figure 2b for a visual illustration of our clustering method. 11From now on, we refer to the portfolio illustrated in Figure 2a as the \"global\" lead-lag portfolio, and we refer to portfolios illustrated in Figure 2b as the \"clustered\" lead-lag portfolio. In the global lead-lag portfolio, we rank the assets into most likely leaders and most likely followers, and we use the returns of the leaders to predict the returns of the followers. In the clustered portfolio, we first cluster the stocks into Kblocks and construct lead-lag portfolios within each block as in Algorithm 1. Initially, we assume zero execution costs, and in Section 4.1 we include trading fees and frictions. (a) Global portfolio (b) Clustered portfolio Figure 2: Global portfolio: Assets are ranked into most likely leaders to most likely followers, and the returns of the leaders are used to predict the returns of the followers, see Algorithm 1. Clustered portfolio: Assets are clustered into Kblocks, and Klead-lag portfolios are constructed within each block as in Algorithm 1. 3 Empirical Results 3.1 Data Asset prices and firm characteristics data are from the Center of Research in Security Prices (CRSP) daily returns database. The sample period is from July 1963 to December 2022. To be consistent with standard literature practices, we include NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ stocks. For each trading day, to ensure that the trading positions we take are feasible, we use only the stocks in the top 25 percentile of market capitalization, which is given by the product of the price of the stock at the end of the day and the number of shares outstanding. For all frequencies (e.g., bidiurnal, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc. ), returns are computed from daily returns as the cumulative product of one plus the end-of-day return of the assets.13For example, for a calendar week with five trading days and raw returns R1, R2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, R5, the raw return of the week is Rweek=Q5 i=1(1 +Ri)\u22121, and the raw return of the week is standardized to compute the L\u00e9vy-area and cross-correlation between pairs of stock returns. 13Daily return for stock nat day tis computed by purchasing the stock on the most recent time previous to twhen the stock had a valid price, see CRSP. 12To study the composition of portfolios, we also include industry classification data. The industry classification informa- tion links each firm to a single, non-overlapping Fama\u2013French 12 industries by its SIC code. The industries are (1) nondurables, (2) durables, (3) manufacturing, (4) energy, (5) chemicals, (6) business equipment, (7) telecommunications, (8) utilities, (9) shops, (10) healthcare, (11) finance, and (12) other. 3.1.1 Summary Statistics Tables 11 to 15 in Appendix E provide summary statistics for the set of assets used in this paper, broken down by decade and by Fama\u2013French sector labels for stocks. Table 11 shows the average number of stocks that are included in our study from 1963 to 2022, split by decade and industry. Recall that on each trading day we construct the portfolio with the stocks in the top 25 percentile by market capitalization. In addition, to compute lagged correlation and L\u00e9vy-area, we use the stocks that do not have missing returns in the previous 60 trading days. From left to right in the table, we see an increasing trend in the number of stocks included in our study, with an average of 143 in the 1960s to 593 in the 2010s. However, the increase in number of stocks is not monotonic and stocks are distributed unequally across industries. For nondurables, durables, manufacturing, and utilities, we observe a monotonic decrease in the number of stocks between the 1990s and the 2010s. This is likely correlated to the evolution of the global economy which caused the number of companies in these four industries to decline in the US. On the other hand, for business equipments, telecommunications, shops, healthcare, and finance stocks, we observe a peak in the number of stocks in the 2000s.",

        "content": "We also observe the same trend in the total number of stocks. The count of stocks in several industries peaks in the 2000s and declines in the 2010s; this observation coincides with the 2008 financial crisis. Table 12 shows the mean and standard deviation of stock prices, and Table 13 shows the mean and standard deviation of stock returns for the stocks we use to build portfolios. Overall, we observe a strong upward trend in the mean and the volatility of stock prices over time, but the average daily return and volatility of stock returns do not undergo considerable changes. The mean and volatility of stocks prices in the finance sector are much higher than those in other sectors. This is primarily caused by the high unit price of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), which lists at approximately 500,000 dollars per share at the time this paper is written.14Meanwhile, for stock returns, we observe an increase in volatility and decrease in mean returns during the 2000s. This is likely correlated to the dotcom bubble and the 2008 financial crisis. We observe this trend across all Fama\u2013French industries. Tables 14 and 15 show the mean and the standard deviation of the volume and of the turnover ratio for the stocks, respectively. There is a clear upward trend in both volume traded and turnover ratio (defined as the quotient of the daily volume of shares traded to the shares outstanding) for stocks, indicating an increase in trading activity. In particular, average daily volume for each stock increased by over five times from the 1970s to the 1980s, over three times from the 1980s to the 1990s, and over five times from the 1990s to the 2000s. Similarly, the turnover ratio of stocks nearly doubles between 1970s and 1980s, 1980s and 1990s, and 1990s and 2000s. This is likely correlated to the emergence 14The mean price of stocks in the finance sector is similar to that of other sectors after removing BRK.A. 13of algorithmic trading in the 1980s and the 1990s, and to the development of high-frequency trading in the 2000s.15 Another possible reason for the change in trading volume and turnover ratio is the decimalisation of the US market in 2001, which reduced spreads and thus lowered execution costs, see Bessembinder (2003). On the other hand, the average turnover of stocks does not undergo large changes from the 2000s to the 2010s (13.6 and 13.2 respectively). Hence, the increase in share volume traded from the 2000s to the 2010s is driven by the increase in shares outstanding. The observed trends in market liquidity are consistent across all industries. 3.2 Evidence of Daily Lead-lag Relationship In this section, we build lead-lag portfolios to investigate lead-lag relationships. We rank the stocks and rebalance the portfolios at a daily frequency because this is the most granular frequency at with one can compare our results with the benchmarks. The benchmark portfolios use firm characteristics that are available at daily frequencies, e.g., market capitalization and trading turnover. We employ Algorithm 1 to construct the portfolios and provide empirical evidence that the data-driven lead-lag portfolios outperform the baseline lead-lag portfolios. For our data-driven lead-lag portfolio, the L\u00e9vy-area and cross-correlation between pairwise stock returns are computed over a 60-day lookback window; the stocks we include on each trading day are the top 20% (i.e., leaders) and bottom 20% (i.e., followers); and the market return is that of the SPY ETF. Recall that we consider the top quantile of all stocks in terms of market capitalization to construct our portfolio. Appendix F presents the results for alternative choices of look-back windows and various choices of the number of leaders and followers.16Additionally, when comparing our portfolios with those in the literature that group stocks into small blocks, we choose spectral clustering to form 12 clusters, which is the same number of Fama\u2013French industries. Appendix F presents the results for alternative choices of clustering methods. To compare our findings with those in Lo and MacKinlay (1990), Chordia and Swaminathan (2000), and Hou (2007), which are our main benchmarks, we adapt their lead-lag portfolio construction procedures to align with that in Algorithm 1.",

We use the SPY ETF to finance all portfolios, as in our data-driven lead-lag portfolios. For Chordia and Swaminathan (2000), we use the same steps as above, except that instead of market capitalization, we use turnover to rank the stocks from leaders to followers. Similarly, for Hou (2007), we group stocks into their respective Fama\u2013French industries and sort them by market capitalization within each group. Next, we use the approach of Lo and MacKinlay (1990) to construct and finance lead-lag portfolios for each industry; therefore, on each trading day, the lead-lag portfolio for Hou (2007) consists of 12 portfolios with zero net initial capital 15Program trading became widely used in the 80s in trading between the SP 500 equity and futures markets (McGowan (2010)). Electronic trading venues known as electronic communications networks (ECNs) emerged in the late 1990s and allowed trading of financial products outside of the traditional stock exchanges (McGowan (2010)). In the US, market share of high-frequency trading increased from less than 20% in 2005 to around 60% in 2009 (Zaharudin et al. (2022)). 16Most of the literature splits stocks into quantiles. They use the top quantile as leaders and bottom quantile as followers. In Appendix F, we use the top 40% of the stocks as leaders and the bottom 40% of stocks as followers. 14(i.e., hold long and short positions of the same dollar value on assets in each portfolio initially). Appendix F provides results for alternative choices of the percentage of stocks that are considered leaders and followers, and Appendix D provides the results for alternative choices of ranking algorithms.

Panel A reports the performance of the data-driven lead-lag portfolios compared with those of Lo and MacKinlay (1990) and Chordia and Swaminathan (2000), denoted by \"Market Cap\" and \"Turnover\", respectively. Panel B shows the comparison between clustered lead-lag portfolios from the data-driven methods and the portfolio from Hou (2007), which is denoted \"Industry\". In both panels, we evaluate the portfolios with five criteria: annualized return, daily return, daily volatility, portfolio Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown of the portfolio. The return of the portfolio reflects the predictive power of the lead-lag relationship; volatility and Sharpe ratio show the risks of lead-lag portfolios; and maximum drawdown indicates when lead-lag relationships temporarily break down. The data-driven lead-lag portfolios outperform the benchmarks on almost all categories except for volatility, see Panel A in Table 1. The daily returns for the portfolios range from 2.37basis points (bps) per day for the Market Cap portfolio to over 9bps per day for the average cross correlation portfolio. The Sharpe ratios of our data-driven portfolios are all above two and the annualized returns are above 20%. In particular, the annualized return of the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio is24.87% over the span of 60 years. Additionally, we compute criteria that are sensitive to risk to understand further the performance of the portfolios. The Sharpe ratios of the data-driven portfolios are higher than those of the two benchmark portfolios based on firm-characteristic-driven lead-lag identifications. This shows that the methods that rank stocks based on pairwise lead-lag relationships capture economically significant lead-lag relationships.",

In Appendix F we show that the Sharpe ratio and annualized return of the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio are also the highest when we propose an alternative choice of proportion of leaders and followers to construct the portfolios. Overall, our results show that the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio outperforms the cross-correlation-based methods. Panel B of Table 1 compares the performances of various clustered lead-lag portfolios. The performances of the Max Cross-Cor, Avg Cross-Cor, L\u00e9vy-area, and Industry portfolios are economically significant, with returns ranging from 5.39 to 6.91 bps/day. The data-driven portfolios Max Cross-Cor, Avg Cross-Cor, and L\u00e9vy-area, outperform the Industry portfolio for most criteria, including annualized return and Sharpe ratio. In particular, compounded return of the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio is 17.5 %, with a relatively low volatility of 0.42 %. In terms of criteria that account for risk exposures, the data-driven portfolios also perform better than the baseline Industry portfolio, with higher Sharpe ratios and lower historical maximum drawdowns. In particular, the Sharpe ratio for the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio is 2.43, which is at least 0.2 higher than that of any other portfolio. This suggests that the data-driven methods used to construct the lead-lag portfolios capture economically significant lead-lag relationships, with the L\u00e9vy-area method being particularly effective. 3.3 Composition of Lead-lag Relationship In this subsection, we study the composition of the data-driven lead-lag portfolios. We employ a three-fold approach to analyze the characteristics of leaders and followers and to compare the composition of the lead-lag portfolios with that of the benchmarks. First, we use the Jaccard score and the overlap coefficient to compute the similarity between data-driven portfolios and the benchmark portfolios. Second, we use the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to compute the similarity between the clusters formed for the data-driven portfolios and the underlying Fama\u2013French sector labels of the stocks, see Hubert (1985). Third, we use a permutation test to assess if, for the leaders and followers, there is a statistically significant difference between the average market capitalization, volume, turnover, unit price, number of shares outstanding, and return. The goal of these three analyses is to understand and quantify the overlap between the constituents of the data-driven lead-lag portfolios found in our study and those reported in the literature. In the first analysis, for each day and for each strategy, we compute the pairwise Jaccard score and the overlap coefficient for the stocks traded by each strategy (i.e., the followers identified by each trading strategy). Figure 3 shows the average Jaccard score and Overlap coefficient. In the comparison, we include portfolios constructed based on Lo and MacKinlay (1990) and Chordia and Swaminathan (2000); recall they are denoted MktCap and Turnover, respectively, and our three data-driven methods are denoted L\u00e9vy, MaxCor, and AvgCor. To compare the similarity between our data-driven strategies and the benchmark, we also include a strategy which trades the union of stocks traded in MktCap and Turnover, which is denoted \"Combined\". The Jaccard coefficient between the Combined strategy and the data-driven strategies is approximately 15 %, and the respective overlap coefficients are around 35 %, which shows that approximately 35 %of the stocks traded in any one of 16MktCap Turnover Combined L\u00e9vy MaxCor AvgCor MktCap Turnover Combined L\u00e9vy MaxCor AvgCor1.0 0.22 0.61 0.12 0.12 0.13 0.22 1.0 0.61 0.12 0.11 0.07 0.61 0.61 1.0 0.15 0.15 0.13 0.12 0.12 0.15 1.0 0.10 0.10 0.12 0.11 0.15 0.10 1.0 0.60 0.13 0.07 0.13 0.10 0.60 1.0Jaccard Coefficients(a) MktCap Turnover Combined L\u00e9vy MaxCor AvgCor MktCap Turnover Combined L\u00e9vy MaxCor AvgCor1.0 0.36 0.61 0.22 0.22 0.24 0.36 1.0 0.61 0.21 0.20 0.13 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.34 0.34 0.31 0.22 0.21 0.21 1.0 0.18 0.18 0.22 0.20 0.21 0.18 1.0 0.75 0.24 0.13 0.19 0.18 0.75 1.0Overlap Coefficients (b) Figure 3: (a) Jaccard coefficients among lead-lag portfolios; a higher value of the Jaccard coefficient represents higher similarity (b) Overlap coefficients among lead-lag portfolios; a higher value of the overlap coefficient represents higher similarity.",

A Jaccard score of 60 %and an overlap coefficient of 75 %between the MaxCor and the AvgCor portfolios show that these two data-driven benchmarks are similar. However, the low similarity between the correlation-based portfolios and the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio shows that L\u00e9vy-area, which detects both linear and nonlinear lead-lag relationships, constructs a considerably different portfolio when compared with all other portfolios, both the data-driven and those proposed by the literature. Next, we use spectral clustering and Hermitian clustering to compute the ARI between clusters formed with the data-driven portfolios and the underlying Fama\u2013French industry labels. By doing this, we compare the clusters that we find with the Fama\u2013French industry labels, used by Hou (2007), and therefore we study the overlap between our portfolios and those of Hou (2007). We split time from 1963 to 2003 into sub-periods and group the stocks into clusters to compare the clusters with the underlying stock sectors. First, we split time into 1000-day windows and form a new matrix with the sum of the lead-lag matrices in each window. In this step, we include stocks that are both in the top quantile in terms of market capitalization and are actively traded over the previous 1000 days. Next, we use spectral clustering and Hermitian clustering to split the new matrix into 12 clusters and use the ARI to compute the similarity between the formed clusters and the underlying sector labels. Panel A of Table 2 presents the results. Panel A in Table 2 shows that the similarity between the clusters for lead-lag portfolios and the Fama\u2013French industry labels is low, with the exception of the Hermitian clusters for the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio. The data-driven portfolios arrange the stocks into groups that are almost unrelated to the industry labels; however, these data-driven clusters show stronger lead-lag relationships within each cluster than those within the Fama\u2013French industries. 17Table 2: Permutation test and adjusted Rand index analysis on Lead-lag portfolios Panel A: Average adjusted Rand index between lead-lag portfolios and the Fama\u2013French industry labels Average ARI Spectral ( %) Average ARI Hermitian ( %) Max Cross-Cor 1.00 5.40 Avg Cross-Cor 3.17 3.19 L\u00e9vy-area 7.71 20.34 Panel B: Characteristics for leaders and followers in the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio Leader Avg Percentile ( %) Follower Avg Percentile ( %) Permutation test p-value Market Cap 54.73 56.15 0.031 V olume 50.53 53.25 <0.001 Turnover 38.82 41.28 0.025 Return 50.07 50.44 <0.001 Price 56.65 55.31 0.103 Shares Outstanding 63.28 66.35 <0.001 The L\u00e9vy-area portfolio with Hermitian clustering is the only case in panel A, Table 2, that is similar to the Fama\u2013French 12 sectors with an ARI of approximately 20%. Figure 4 provides a visualization of clusters in the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio for the 1000-day window from 2019 to 2022. In the figure, each colored short dash represents a stock where the horizontal position represents cluster membership, and the vertical position represents sector membership. The black vertical lines represent the boundaries between each cluster. Figure 4 shows that Hermitian clustering detects six clusters that are quite similar to the underlying sector labels. The six clusters are mostly Energy stocks, Finance stocks, Business Equipments, Shops, Utilities, and Healthcare stocks, respectively. However, it is difficult to determine if the remaining six clusters and the sectors are similar. The third analysis contains the permutation tests on the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio; see results in Panel B, Table 2. On each trading day, we compute the percentile score for each stock\u2019s average L\u00e9vy-area, market capitalization, turnover, volume, price, number of shares outstanding, and return for all stocks traded on that day. Next, we take the average of these percentile scores for each stock over its respective lifespan of active trading and sort all stocks that are ever traded (approximately 5000) by their average percentile of their L\u00e9vy-area. We take the top quantile as leaders and the bottom quantile as followers, and we use the permutation test to verify if there is a statistically significant difference between the mean of market capitalization, turnover, volume, and return of the leaders and the followers.",

This difference is significant at the 5 %confidence level for market capitalization and turnover, and it is significant at the 0.1 %confidence level for volume and return. The differences in market capitalization, volume, and turnover of the leaders and the followers coincide with results in the literature; however, the extant literature does not discuss the differences in the returns for the leaders and followers. The discussion of why the leaders have higher historical average returns is beyond the scope of this paper and we defer this to future work. Results for alternative choices of portfolios are included in Appendix G. 3.4 Sector lead-lag characteristics In this section, we study if some sectors tend to contain more leaders and others contain more followers. Specifically, on each day, we use the ranking we infer from the lead-lag matrix to compute the percentile rank of each stock on each trading day. Then, we compute the average percentile rank for each Fama\u2013French sector over time to understand the composition of each sector. We also inspect how the sector lead-lag identities evolve over time to understand if there is a change in the dynamics of sector-wise lead-lag relationships from 1963 to 2022. Table 3 presents the average percentile ranks of stocks in various sectors for different lead-lag matrix constructions from 1963 to 2022. The average percentile rank provides insights into the leader or follower status of each sector, with a lower rank indicating a higher proportion of leaders and a higher rank indicating a larger proportion of followers. The results highlight that the inter-industry lead-lag relationships are predominantly significant for the lead-lag relationship detected by the L\u00e9vy-area method. Sectors such as Manufacturing, Chemicals, and Energy exhibit much 19Table 3: Average percentile rank of stocks in each sector for various lead-lag matrix constructions L\u00e9vy-area MaxCor AvgCor Manufacturing 47.6 50.1 50.1 Chemicals 48.5 50.4 50.4 Energy 49.4 50.4 50.4 Telecom 49.5 50.4 50.2 Healthcare 49.6 49.9 50.0 Utilities 49.8 50.7 50.5 Non-durables 49.9 50.2 50.1 Shops 50.1 50.6 50.5 Finance 50.3 50.0 50.0 Other 50.4 49.8 49.8 Durables 51.1 50.1 50.2 Business equipments 55.4 50.1 50.0 lower average percentile ranks, suggesting a higher proportion of leader stocks in these sectors. This coincides with the observation in Frazzini and Cohen (2008) that lead-lag relationships exist between customer-supplier linked firms with the supplier firms being leaders. On the other hand, the Business Equipments sector stands out with a notably higher average percentile rank, indicating a larger number of follower stocks within the sector. This implies that the stocks in Business Equipments tend to lag behind the other sectors. Overall, the L\u00e9vy-area method appears to detect inter-industry lead-lag relationships and finds sectors that tend to persistently contain leaders or followers. In contrast, the cross-correlation-based lead-lag matrix constructions, including MaxCor and AvgCor, do not show significant differences in percentile rank across sectors. This suggests that the follower and the leader dynamics found by these methods are less persistent across sectors. The sectors demonstrate relatively similar average percentile ranks, indicating a balanced mix of leader and follower stocks within these sectors. This result likely shows that the cross-correlation-based methods do not account for the inter-industry lead-lag effects found by the L\u00e9vy-area method.",

We observe a significant shift in lead-lag identity across sectors over time. Business Equipments consistently lags other sectors from 1963 to around 2000, but does not rank at the bottom from 2000 onward; Finance exhibits strong leadership from 2017 onwards, but oscillates between leading and lagging prior to 2017. Utilities gradually shifts from a consistent leader in the 1970s to a consistent follower in the 1990s. Thus, the lead-lag relationships across sectors change, and the relationship constantly evolves over time. 201963 1965 1967 1969 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 YearNon-durables Durables Manufacturing Energy Chemicals Business Equipments T elecom Utilities Shops Healthcare FinanceIndustriesRank Changes Over Time 0.30.40.50.60.70.8 Figure 5: Change in sector rank of average lead-lag score for the L\u00e9vy-area lead-lag matrix construction from 1963 to 2022. 3.5 Lead-lag Relationship for Various Time Scales In this section, we investigate the lead-lag relationships for various time frequencies, which is a new contribution to the existing literature. Specifically, we explore the daily, bidiurnal, weekly, bi-weekly, tri-weekly, and monthly time frequencies to gain insight into the persistence of the lead-lag relationships. By doing so, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of these relationships and how their temporal dynamics evolve from 1963 to 2022. 3.5.1 Performance of Lead-lag portfolios for Various Time Scales Most of the extant literature including Chordia and Swaminathan (2000), Hou (2007), Frazzini and Cohen (2008), Parsons et al. (2020), and Huang et al. (2022) hypothesize that lead-lag effects are consequences of the slow information diffusion. If this hypothesis holds, then lead-lag relationships should disappear as we reduce the time frequency with which we detect the relationship. Therefore, one would expect the performance of the lead-lag portfolios to decrease as the frequency with which one ranks leaders and followers decreases. To analyze the lead-lag relationships at different frequencies, we aggregate returns from daily to other frequencies and compute the pairwise lead-lag scores as before. Recall that, to compute weekly lead-lag relationships, we compute weekly raw returns Rt\u22125:t= \u03a0 j\u2208[0,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,5](1 +Rt\u2212j)\u22121and relabel the return Rt\u22125:tasRtw, where twis the wth 21natural week of the year. Next, we normalize the computed weekly returns to feed into the steps in Algorithm 1 to detect lead-lag relationships.

We also observe an overall upward trend in portfolio volatility as rebalance frequency decreases. 22The results in Table 4 support the slow information diffusion hypothesis. The strength of lead-lag relationship erodes as the time between ranking of stocks and rebalancing the portfolios becomes longer. This result suggests that the market slowly absorbs the lead-lag relationship induced by the slow diffusion of information, and the residual lead-lag relationship at a monthly frequency becomes economically insignificant. 3.5.2 Slow Information Diffusion Hypothesis and the Speed of the Market Table 4 shows that the lead-lag relationship is strongest when we detect the lead-lag profiles and rebalance the portfolios both on daily frequencies. Portfolio performance weakens as the frequency of lead-lag detection and of portfolio rebalancing decreases. Thus, have daily lead-lag relationships consistently outperformed lead-lag relationships at lower frequencies throughout the entire historical period? In this section, our study points to the time when the daily data-driven lead-lag portfolios first outperform the lower- frequency portfolios. As Table 4 suggests, there is a point in time beyond which the daily lead-lag portfolios outperform all lower-frequency lead-lag portfolios; however, in the earlier years of our study, the daily lead-lag portfolio does not consistently outperform lower-frequency portfolios. For example, the daily L\u00e9vy-area portfolio begins to outperform the weekly L\u00e9vy-area portfolio in the mid to late-1970s; see Figure 6. 1963 1973 1983 1993 2002 2012 2022 Time0123456Cumulative PnLCumulative difference between daily and weekly L\u00e9vy-area portfolios Figure 6: Cumulative sum of the difference between the daily lead-lag L\u00e9vy-area portfolio returns and the weekly lead-lag L\u00e9vy-area portfolio returns To further explore how the frequency of lead-lag detection and rebalancing affects the returns of the three data-driven lead-lag portfolios, we record the first time these lead-lag portfolios outperform each of their corresponding lower- 23frequency portfolios. In particular, we track the initial occurrence of a cumulative excess return of 50 %and 100 %in the daily portfolio compared with the lower-frequency portfolios in Table 5. threeparttable Table 5: Dates when daily lead-lag portfolios first outperform lower frequency lead-lag portfolios\u2020 Panel A: First occurrence of a cumulative excess return of 50 %between daily and lower-frequency portfolios Raw Bidiurnally Weekly Bi-weekly Tri-weekly Monthly L\u00e9vy-area 1968.07 1973.04 1981.09 1980.09 1978.10 1971.02 Max Cross-Corr 1968.03 1974.07 1996.02 1982.07 1975.08 1970.08 Avg Cross-Corr 1968.02 1974.01 1995.06 1985.02 1982.08 1973.12 Panel B: First occurrence of a cumulative excess return of 100 %between daily and lower-frequency portfolios Raw Bidiurnally Weekly Bi-weekly Tri-weekly Monthly L\u00e9vy-area 1973.04 1974.09 1987.10 1981.11 1981.03 1974.12 Max Cross-Corr 1971.04 1990.08 1999.08 1985.09 1983.02 1974.07 Avg Cross-Corr 1970.06 1982.12 1996.02 1987.10 1984.07 1981.08 We use format YYYY .MM to express year and month in this table. Table 5 presents the first month after January 1963 when the cumulatively gained profit of daily lead-lag portfolios is at least50% and100% above the cumulative returns of each of the lower-frequency portfolios. We also record the first month when the daily lead-lag portfolio cumulatively earns over 50% and100% profit under the \"Raw\" column. With the exception of bidiurnal lead-lag portfolios, we observe a clear trend in the time when the daily lead-lag portfolios start to outperform the lower-frequency portfolios. The daily portfolios cumulatively outperform the monthly portfolios first, starting from the 1970s, and then outperform the tri-weekly, bi-weekly, and weekly portfolio in chronological order during the 1980s and the 1990s. For bidiurnal portfolios, however, we observe that the daily lead-lag portfolios outperform the bidiurnal portfolios much sooner than the daily portfolios outperform the weekly, and the tri-weekly portfolios. Results in Table 5 lend further support to the slow information diffusion hypothesis, which asserts that lead-lag relationships are caused by the different speeds with which information is impounded into the leaders and the followers. In such cases, it takes between a week and a month for most of the information to diffuse to the followers in the early 1970s; over time, some information is impounded on the next day of trading whereas some residual information still takes weeks to trickle down to the followers.",

        "content": "Over time, more information is absorbed and reflected in the prices of the followers on the next trading day and less relevant information is left to be captured at the lower frequencies, which causes the daily rebalanced portfolio to outperform the lower frequency portfolios. The timings of changes in relative portfolio performances coincide with times when technological advancements enabled faster trading activities such as electronic execution and high-frequency trading, see McGowan (2010). On the other hand, the bidiurnal frequency presents a unique dynamic. The literature does not compare performance of portfolios rebalanced at daily and bidiurnally, weekly, or monthly periods. Smith and Desormeau (2006) and Dennis 24et al. (1995) explore rebalancing periods over much slower frequencies such as annually or once every two years. We conjecture that if an investor possesses the technological capability to trade on a bidiurnal basis, it is likely that they can trade daily. As a result, market participants, especially informed traders who can trade at higher frequencies may find little incentive to trade bidiurnally because trading daily allows them to benefit from information asymmetries quicker than trading of lower frequencies. Consequently, the daily portfolios outperform the bidiurnal portfolio faster than they outperform the lower-frequency portfolios; we leave the discussion of this hypothesis to future work. 4 Robustness Analysis In this section, we present the results of a number of robustness checks and alternative specifications in our study. The appendix includes further robustness analysis. 4.1 Execution Cost and Trading Turnover Here, we explore the impact of trading frictions on the performance of the lead-lag portfolios. We study performances of both the data-driven portfolios and the benchmark portfolios as a function of trading frictions. To estimate the execution costs for a given portfolio, we first estimate the execution costs for trading one dollar worth of equity in the US market and then multiply this value by the turnover of the portfolio. The turnover of a portfolio that trades dt 1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, dt ndollar value in stocks s1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, snat time tis defined as TVR t=Pn i=1|dt i\u2212dt\u22121 i|Pn i=1|dt\u22121 i|, (7) where |dt i\u2212dt\u22121 i|is the change in dollar value held by the portfolio on asset siin between rebalances. For each portfolio, we compute its daily turnover and explore the portfolio\u2019s performance as a function of per-dollar execution cost. Figure 7a shows Sharpe ratios of the portfolios as a function of execution costs, and Figure 7b shows the returns of the portfolios as a function of execution costs. For each strategy, Table 6 presents the mean and standard deviation of its daily turnover ratio.

Figures 7a and 7b show that the data-driven lead-lag portfolios are significantly more robust to execution costs than the benchmark portfolios in terms of Sharpe ratio and annualized return. The Market Cap portfolio and the Turnover portfolio deliver losses when execution costs on each dollar traded is larger than 4 bps;17on the other hand, the data-driven portfolios are profitable when execution costs are 7 bps or lower, and their Sharpe ratio remains above 1 when execution costs are 4 bps. We analyze the turnover ratio of the data-driven portfolios and of the benchmark portfolios in Table 6. We split the turnover ratio of the portfolios into two components, change in portfolio composition and sign flips.",

        "content": "When the sign of the signal changes (i.e., the sign of the return of the leaders change), the turnover ratio of the portfolio is 2 regardless of the changes in the composition of the portfolio; on the other hand, when there is no sign flip, the turnover ratio of the portfolio is the proportion of the followers that change from the previous day\u2019s portfolio. Table 6 reports the average daily turnover ratio, average proportional change in portfolio composition, and the proportion of days when the sign of the signal flips. Table 6 shows that ratio of turnover of the the data-driven portfolios is higher than that of the Market Cap portfolio and the Turnover portfolio. The composition of the data-driven lead-lag portfolios tends to change more than the baseline portfolios, but their proportion of sign flips is similar. Figures 7a and 7b show that the higher turnover ratio is not sufficient to offset the difference in performance between the data-driven portfolios and the baseline portfolios. Finally, there is no bid-offer spread during the close auction, so our portfolios are not affected by the bid-offer spread that one would face during regular trading hours. Specifically, during the closing auction, buy and sell orders are collected and at a specified closing time, these orders are matched and executed at a single close price. 17Currently, industry standard on trading a portfolio on large cap US equities is less than 3 bps per dollar. The fees for taking short positions is around 1 bps per dollar. 264.2 Exposure to illiquidity premium and Fama\u2013French Factors Amihud (2002) suggests that stock illiquidity positively affects stock excess return, and this phenomenon is referred to as illiquidity premium. In this section, we explore if the lead-lag portfolios we construct can be explained by the illiquidity premium of stocks and by other common risk factors. We measure the illiquidity of stocks as the daily ratio of absolute stock return to its dollar volume, see Amihud (2002). Next, we construct a portfolio that consists of a long position in stocks with the highest 20% illiquidity measure and a short position in stocks with the lowest 20% illiquidity measure; we denote by Rliq tthe returns of such portfolio for each dayt. We use linear models to explore if the illiquidity portfolio adds value in explaining the returns of our lead-lag portfolio, and we also explore if the returns of our lead-lag portfolio can be explained by the benchmark lead-lag portfolios discussed in section 3.2, and by the Fama\u2013French five factors. Consider the models RL\u00e9vy t=\u03b1+\u03b2capRcap t+\u03b2tvrRtvr t+\u03f5t, (M1) RL\u00e9vy t=\u03b1+\u03b2liqRliq t+\u03b2capRcap t+\u03b2tvrRtvr t+\u03f5t, (M2) RL\u00e9vy t=\u03b1+\u03b2liqRliq t+\u03b2capRcap t+\u03b2tvrRtvr t+X Fama5\u03b2FF5RFF5 t+\u03f5t, (M3) where RL\u00e9vy tis the return of the L\u00e9vy-area lead-lag portfolio on a daily rebalancing frequency, Rcap tandRtvr tare returns of the two benchmark lead-lag portfolios based on market capitalization and stock turnover ratios, and RFF5 tare the returns of the five-factor Fama\u2013French portfolios.

Overall, we observe that on average, around 10 to 11 basis points of the daily returns of the L\u00e9vy-Area lead-lag portfolio cannot be explained by the risk factors and benchmark portfolios we include in the models. Notably, the L\u00e9vy-Area lead-lag portfolio exhibits a positive 27exposure to the market capitalization lead-lag portfolio, indicating a propensity to select smaller-sized stocks.",

        "content": "On the other hand, it demonstrates a negative exposure to the Turnover ratio lead-lag portfolio and the illiquidity premium portfolio, suggesting a preference for more liquid stocks and for stocks with higher turnover ratios. Results for M2 and M3 show that the returns of the L\u00e9vy-Area lead-lag portfolio are not statistically significantly explained by the Fama\u2013French five factors after considering lead-lag relationship related to size and liquidity. We observe no significant difference in the intercept and R2between the two models, and the coefficients on the Fama\u2013 French five factors are both small in magnitude and statistically insignificant. Furthermore, comparisons between M1 and M2 imply some collinearity between the illiquidity premium portfolio and the Turnover ratio lead-lag portfolio. The addition of the illiquidity premium portfolio to the regressions results in a 0.1% increase in R2, and the coefficient on the Turnover ratio lead-lag portfolio becomes statistically insignificant. These findings suggest that the illiquidity premium portfolio does not contribute significantly to explaining the returns of the L\u00e9vy-Area lead-lag portfolio beyond the information provided by the two benchmark lead-lag portfolios included in the analysis. 4.3 Alternative Selection of Sets of Stocks In this subsection, we show that the lead-lag relationship we detect is robust to alternative selection of the set of stocks. In our data-driven baseline results, the set of stocks in a given trading day consisted of the top 25percentile in terms of market capitalization in that day. This choice ensures that the portfolios we construct can be traded at scale in the market. To assess the robustness of our results for a different set of stocks, we select those that rank at the top 25percentile in terms of both volume traded and turnover ratio. We obtain a smaller set of stocks than the one used above because volume and turnover ratio vary more than market capitalization. On average, this new set of stocks contains approximately one third of the stocks that we use in the main results above. Table 8 reports the results for this alternative set of stocks. Panel A of Table 8 compares the performance of the lead-lag portfolios without clustering. The daily returns for the portfolios range from 1.80bps per day for the Market Cap portfolio to over 17bps per day for the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio. The data-driven portfolios outperform the two benchmark portfolios for all criteria except for volatility and maximum drawdown. The performances of portfolios with the alternative set of stocks show the same relative hierarchy as in the main results presented above. In particular, the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio achieves 51.85% annualized return. The Sharpe ratio of the data-driven portfolios is higher than those of the two portfolios based on firm characteristics. This shows that the data-driven methods capture economically significant lead-lag relationships in the alternative set of stocks. In particular, the Sharpe ratio and annualized returns of the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio are the highest among the three data-driven methods in panel A of Table 8. Panel B of Table 1 compares the performances of various clustered lead-lag portfolios. The performances of the Max Cross-Cor, Avg Cross-Cor, and L\u00e9vy-area portfolios are economically significant, with returns ranging from 9.18 to 28Table 8: Performance of lead-lag portfolios in the alternative set of stocks Panel A: Global Lead-Lag Portfolios Compound Return ( %)Return (bps/day) V olatility ( %) Sharpe Ratio Max Drawdown (%) Max Cross-Cor 35.57 12.08 1.90 1.01 82.47 Avg Cross-Cor 48.69 15.75 2.09 1.20 76.44 L\u00e9vy-area 51.85 16.59 2.08 1.27 91.31 Market Cap 4.62 1.80 1.77 0.16 99.60 Turnover 21.48 7.72 1.23 1.00 52.49 Panel B: Clustered Lead-lag Portfolios Compound Return ( %)Return (bps/day) V olatility ( %) Sharpe Ratio Max Drawdown (%) Max Cross-Cor 26.03 9.18 1.08 1.35 46.28 Avg Cross-Cor 27.61 9.68 1.16 1.33 36.10 L\u00e9vy-area 31.45 10.86 1.18 1.46 40.53 Industry 4.55 1.77 1.39 0.21 87.55 10.86 bps/day.

The data-driven portfolios, Max Cross-Cor, Avg Cross-Cor, and L\u00e9vy-area, outperform the Industry portfolio in all categories. In particular, the compounded return of the L\u00e9vy-area portfolio is 31.45 %, and its Sharpe ratio of 1.46 is the highest.",

        "content": "This suggests that the data-driven methods used in constructing the lead-lag portfolios capture economically significant lead-lag relationships, with the L\u00e9vy-area method being particularly effective, and are robust to this alternative set of stocks. When compared with the results in Table 1, the performance of the portfolios for the alternative set of stocks is less economically significant. Although the annualized returns of portfolios in panel A of Table 8 are almost twice the value of those in Table 8, the volatility of returns of portfolios for the alternative set of stocks is almost four times the volatility of the portfolios in Table 1. Therefore, the Sharpe ratio results in Table 8 are half the value of those shown in Table 1. This result shows that including more stocks benefits the performance of lead-lag portfolios, while the gap in performance between the data-driven portfolios and the portfolios based on firm characteristics remains robust to the selection of the set of stocks. Furthermore, the benchmark portfolios with the alternative set of stocks perform worse than those with the set of stocks discussed above; meanwhile, the data-driven portfolios still remain economically significant. This shows that the data-driven methods in lead-lag detection are robust and transferable to various sets of assets. 294.4 Intermediate Lead-lag Relationships In this section, we show that the lead-lag relationship we find is robust to considering the so-called \"intermediate lead-lag relationships\". Recall that when identifying leaders and followers among the assets, we apply ranking methods to sort the assets from most likely to lead to most likely to follow and construct a portfolio that uses the returns of assets that rank at the top to predict the returns of the assets that rank at the bottom. While this method provides a criterion to evaluate lead-lag relationships, it neglects assets that rank in the middle of the sorting. Consider, for example, a set of three assets a, b, c , where asset branks in the middle, follows a, and leads c. In this case, asset bexhibits an \"intermediate lead-lag relationship\" as it is not included in the lead-lag portfolio, but possesses lead-lag relationships with other assets. It is also possible that asset bhas no relationship with aorc. Here, we extend the lead-lag detection mechanisms we designed above to study intermediate lead-lag relationships. For each trading day, we rank the assets into quantiles, denoted by Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, respectively. Instead of using the previous return of Q1to predict the return of Q4as in Algorithm 1, we construct three portfolios in which we sequentially use Q1to predict Q2,Q2to predict Q3, and Q3to predict Q4. We finance each of the three portfolios with a position in the SPY ETF and take the average of the three portfolios to construct the final portfolio, see Figure 8. Figure 8: Portfolio construction of lead-lag portfolio with intermediate lead-lag relationships The portfolio illustrated in Figure 8 considers the intermediate lead-lag relationships, so measuring the performance of the portfolio can help to understand if these relationships are economically significant. Table 9 reports the performance of the L\u00e9vy-area, Max Cross-Cor, and Avg Cross-Cor, respectively. Table 9: Intermediate Lead-lag Relationships Compound Return ( %)Return (bps/day) V olatility ( %) Sharpe Ratio Max Drawdown (%) Max Cross-Cor 16.1 5.91 0.40 2.37 15.8 Avg Cross-Cor 14.8 5.48 0.35 2.52 14.1 L\u00e9vy-area 20.4 7.36 0.40 2.89 14.7 30The table shows that the lead-lag portfolios are economically significant after considering intermediate lead-lag relationships. However, compared with the results without considering intermediate lead-lag relationships in Table 1 where the top 20% of stocks are considered leaders and the bottom 20% of stocks are considered followers, the portfolios in Table 9 show lower return, but obtain lower volatility, higher Sharpe ratio, and lower maximum drawdown. Thus, the results show that our method is robust to considering intermediate lead-lag relationships and that intermediate lead-lag relationships do exist in the equities market. 5 Conclusion This paper presented a method to detect linear and nonlinear lead-lag relationships in the US equity market.",

        "content": "In contrast to the extant literature, which uses firm characteristics such as market capitalization, trading turnover, and trading volume to select leaders and followers, our method employs the L\u00e9vy-area between pairs of stock returns to infer which one in the pair is more likely the leader, and to quantify the strength of this relationship. We constructed a portfolio that uses the previous returns of the leaders to determine positions on the followers; and showed that they generate economically significant performances that outperform all benchmarks in the literature. The performance of our portfolios is robust to various alternative specifications in algorithms, hyperparameters, and data sets. The performance of the lead-lag portfolios we construct cannot be fully explained by lead-lag effects generated by market capitalization, trading volume, or intra-industry; there is little overlap between the composition of our lead-lag portfolios and that of the benchmarks. Our results show that accounting for nonlinearities is key to determine the lead-lag relationships. The lead-lag relationships we find change over time. The leader-follower identity of stocks in various sectors changes several times between 1963 and 2022. This finding further supports the necessity of data-driven lead-lag detection methods that capture dynamically evolving lead-lag relationships. Finally, we examined the performance of our portfolios across various rebalancing frequencies, and the results provided empirical support to confirm the slow information diffusion hypothesis. Specifically, the performance of portfolios decreases as both the ranking and the rebalancing are performed less frequently. Our research leads to various future directions of work. One, explore lead-lag relationship on intra-day data, for alternative markets, and in alternative asset classes. Such a study might explain the relative differences in performance of lead-lag portfolios that are rebalanced at various frequencies over time. Two, understand the analytical properties of the nonlinear relationship between leaders and followers with methods such as smoothing or other non-parametric approaches. This direction can help to understand the source and composition of lead-lag relationships from the perspective of lagged factor exposures or other asset pricing models. Finally, we intentionally kept the construction of portfolios simple in this paper; future work is to study advanced portfolio construction methods that optimize the portfolio positions based on the lead-lag relationships we uncover. 31References Amihud, Y .

Dynamic Time Warping for Lead-Lag Relationships in Lagged Multi-Factor Models. to appear in Proceedings of the Fourth ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF 2023); SSRN:4572554 . 34A Appendix 0: Notable lead-lag pairs as motivating examples We present several motivating examples of pairwise lead-lag relationships that we detect. Some examples show the time-varying property of lead-lag relationships while others present examples of lead-lag relationships that cannot easily reconcile with what the literature discovered in the past. For each proposed lead-lag pair, we consider a pairs trading strategies where one uses the previous time period return of the leader as an indicator to buy or sell the follower at the current time period. Figure 9 presents returns of pairs trading strategies that illustrate the time-varying property of lead-lag relationships. Example 9a shows that a ten-year lead-lag relationship between INCY , a pharmaceutical company and Tesla breaks in October 2019 when Tesla had a surprisingly good earnings announcement. Example 9b shows that a collection of lead-lag relationships between ENPH, a Californian energy company and several technology firms including AAPL, GOOG, and AMZN started to appear in mid-2020, coinciding COVID. These two motivating examples show that lead-lag relationships can appear and disappear between pairs of stocks, which suggests that it is necessary to detect, instead of assume, lead-lag relationships over rolling windows. 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 Date012345Cumulative ReturnLeader = INCY, Follower = TSLA (a) Returns of INCY-TSLA lead-lag pair 2019-07 2020-01 2020-07 2021-01 2021-07 2022-01 2022-07 2023-01 Date0.25 0.000.250.500.751.001.251.50Cumulative ReturnLeader = ENPH, Follower = T ech companies AAPL GOOG AMZN (b) Returns of ENPH-Tech lead-lag pairs 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020 Date0123456Cumulative ReturnLeader = DIS, Follower = WYNN WYNN (c) Returns of DIS-WYNN lead-lag pair 2000 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 Date02468Cumulative ReturnLeader = NVDA, Follower = AMD (d) Returns of NVDA-AMD lead-lag pair Figure 9: Motivating examples of pairwise lead-lag relationships. Example 9c shows that a twenty-year lead-lag relationship between Disney and WYNN, a casino and resort company. Wynn Resorts has larger market cap than Disney and there is no clear economic links between the two companies; therefore, one cannot easily explain this lead-lag pair using lead-lag relationships discovered in the literature. On the other hand, Example 9d shows a surprising lead-lag relationship between NVIDIA and AMD, two GPU companies. This example is built on a weekly frequency, i.e., the pairs trading strategy is executed only weekly. It is surprising that 35a simple weekly pairs trading strategy (orange) between two firms that are clearly economically linked is still profitable in 2023. B Appendix 1: Introduction to Signature and L\u00e9vy-area We provide a brief introduction to the concept of Signature and L\u00e9vy-area in this section, see Lyons (2014), Gyurk\u00f3 et al. (2013), and Chevyrev and Kormilitzin (2016) for more details. First, we define the concept of a real, continuous path. Definition B.1. A real, continuous path defined on the interval [0, T]is a continuous function f: [0, T]\u2192R. For a path Xt=\u0000 X1 t,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, Xd t\u0001 where each Xj tis a real and continuous path, consider the dkdimensional set I0with elements (ii,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, ik)withk\u22650andim\u2208 {1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, d}form= 1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, k. The signature Ss,t(X)of the path Xover a time interval [s, t]is a map from Xto a sequence\u0000 S(X)I s,t\u0001 I\u2208I0, where S(X)I s,t=Z s<u 1<u2<\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7<uk<tdXii u1dXi2 u2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7dXikuk. (A.1) Any elements ip, iqin the set I0can be different or the same, and hence if the entries of Ss,t(X)are iterated, one obtains expressions such as S(X)1,1,2 s,t orS(X)1,2,2 s,t. For a clearer intuition, note that the signature of Xcan be expanded as S(X)s,t= (1, S(X)1 s,t,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, S(X)d s,t, S(X)1,1 s,t, S(X)1,2 s,t,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7). (A.2) Here, for the first-order terms in S(X)s,t, it is clear that S(X)i s,t=Xi t\u2212Xi s, and by definition, the higher-order terms inS(X)s,tcan also be iteratively calculated as S(X)i,j s,t=Z s<a<tS(X)i s,adXj a. (A.3) The L\u00e9vy-area between two paths XiandXiis Ai,j=1 2(S(X)i,j s,t\u2212S(X)j,i s,t). (A.4) For a more intuitive understanding of Theorem 1, Figure 10 shows a two-dimensional continuous path with dimensions X1={X1 0,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, X1 3}andX2={X2 0,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, X2 3}.",

(B.1) Next, write the right-hand side of (B.1) as S(X)i,j s,t\u2212S(X)j,i s,t=Z s<a<tZ s<b<adXi bdXj a\u2212Z s<a<tZ s<b<adXj bdXi a. (B.2) Integrate the inner parts of the right-hand side of (B.2) to obtain Z s<a<tZ s<b<adXi bdXj a\u2212Z s<a<tZ s<b<adXj bdXi a=Z s<a<t(Xi a\u2212Xi s)dXj a\u2212Z s<a<t(Xj a\u2212Xi s)dXi a. (B.3) Without loss of generality, assume that Xi s=Xj s= 0(i.e., the return of assets at the start of time is 0), and hence we have S(X)i,j s,t\u2212S(X)j,i s,t=Z s<a<tXi adXj a\u2212Z s<a<tXj adXi a. (B.4) 37The integration can be transformed into finite summations S(X)i,j s,t\u2212S(X)j,i s,t=X s<a<tXi a\u2206Xj a\u2212X s<a<tXj a\u2206Xi a =X s<a<tXi a(Xj a\u2212Xj a\u22121)\u2212X s<a<tXj a(Xi a\u2212Xi a\u22121) =X s<a<t\u2212Xi aXj a\u22121\u2212X s<a<t\u2212Xj aXi a\u22121(B.5) because the processes Xi tandXj tare discrete. Substitute in the lead-lag equation Xi a=\u03b2\u2113f(Xj a\u2212\u2113) +\u03f5into equation (B.5) to obtain X s<a<t\u2212Xi aXj a\u22121\u2212X s<a<t\u2212Xj aXi a\u22121=X s<a<tXj a(\u03b2\u2113f(Xj a\u2212\u2113\u22121) +\u03f5) \u2212X s<a<tXj a\u22121(\u03b2\u2113f(Xj a\u2212\u2113) +\u03f5). (B.6) Next, take expectation on both sides to reduce equation (B.6) to E\"X s<a<tXj aXi a\u22121\u2212X s<a<tXi aXj a\u22121# =E\"X s<a<t\u03b2\u2113f(Xj a\u2212l)Xj a\u22121\u2212X s<a<t\u03b2\u2113f(Xj a\u2212l\u22121)Xj a# . (B.7) Here, considerP s<a<t\u03b2\u2113f(Xj a\u2212\u2113\u22121)Xj a\u22480because we assume that the auto-correlation in the time series is very small compared to the variance of the time series. Therefore, it is clear that the expectation on the right-hand side is non-zero only if \u2113= 1; hence, we consider E[P s<a<t\u03b2\u2113f(Xj a\u22121)Xj a\u22121]. First, suppose fis a polynomial. Then for each of the terms of fwe have that E[(Xj a\u22121)2k+1Xj a\u22121]\u22650and E[(Xj a\u22121)2kXj a\u22121] = 0 for any positive integer kbecause (Xj a\u22121)2k+1is an odd function as Xjhas mean zero and a symmetric distribution. The expectation E[P s<a<t\u03b2(Xj a\u22121)Xj a\u22121]is positive if \u03b2\u2113\u22650because we assume all derivatives of fare non-negative for any monic polynomial f. Now, by the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem, the set of polynomials is dense in the Banach space C\u221e(Rn), hence for any continuous function f, there exists a sequence of polynomials fnsuch that the sequence converges to funder the infinity norm. Hence, we have shown that for all continuous functions f, the sign of E[P s<a<t\u03b2(Xj a\u22121)Xj a\u22121]andl is the same if and only if \u2113= 1when \u2113 >0. And by symmetry, the sign of E[P s<a<t\u03b2(Xj a\u22121)Xj a\u22121]and\u2113are the same if and only if \u2113=\u22121when \u2113 <0. This proves the first part of the theorem. For the second part of the theorem, suppose fhas third order derivatives at 0 (without loss of generality), then by Taylor\u2019s theorem there exists a polynomial p(Xj a\u22121)such that it approximates f(Xj a\u22121)with some third-order error termM 6f\u2032\u2032\u2032(\u03bej a\u22121)(Xj a\u22121)3for some |\u03bej a\u22121|<|Xj a\u22121|, i.e., p(Xj a\u22121) =f(0) + f\u2032(0)Xj a\u22121+1 2f\u2032\u2032(0) (Xj a\u22121)2+1 6f\u2032\u2032\u2032(0) (Xj a\u22121)3 f(Xj a\u22121)\u2212p(Xj a\u22121) =M 6f\u2032\u2032\u2032(\u03bej a\u22121) (Xj a\u22121)3. (B.8) 38Hence, E\"X s<a<t\u03b2\u2113f(Xj a\u22121)Xj a\u22121# =E\"X s<a<t\u03b2\u2113(f(0) + f\u2032(0)Xj a\u22121+1 2f\u2032\u2032(0) (Xj a\u22121)2+M 6f\u2032\u2032\u2032(\u03bej a\u22121) (Xj a\u22121)3)Xj a\u22121# =E\"X s<a<t\u03b2\u2113(f\u2032(0)(Xj a\u22121)2+M 6f\u2032\u2032\u2032(\u03bej a\u22121) (Xj a\u22121)4)# =E\" (t\u2212s)\u03b2\u2113f\u2032(0)) + E X s<a<tM 6\u03b2\u2113f\u2032\u2032\u2032(\u03bej a\u22121) (Xj a\u22121)4!# . (B.9) The term E[(t\u2212s)\u03b2\u2113f\u2032(0)]only depends on f, so if we fix f, we write this term as C0\u03b2\u2113. The left-hand side of (B.9) is the expectation of the L\u00e9vy-area, and hence by rearranging the equation we have Eh ALvy i,j\u2212C0\u03b2\u2113i =M 6\u03b2\u2113E\"X s<a<tf\u2032\u2032\u2032(\u03bej a\u22121) (Xj a\u22121)4# .",

        "content": "(B.10) Hence, if fis chosen so that the third derivative is small relative to C0, and if the historical returns of assets are much smaller than 1, the L\u00e9vy-area provides a good approximation to the lead-lag coefficient \u03b2\u2113. 39D Appendix 3: Alternative Ranking Methods Throughout the paper, we identified leaders and followers based on a column average ranking on the lead-lag matrix. Here, we use SpringRank by De Bacco et al. (2018), Serial Ranking by Fogel et al. (2014), and SyncRank by Cucuringu (2015) to construct the same portfolios as in the previous sections of the paper. In synthetic data simulations where we test the ability of these ranking algorithms to identify lead-lag relationships with various levels of noise, we observe that all three alternative ranking methods above can detect lead-lag relationships. In particular, SpringRank produces very similar rankings as those by the method we used in the main parts of this paper (i.e., ranking by column average); on the other hand, Serial Ranking and SyncRank are more sensitive to the level of noise, the size of the lag than SpringRank, and ranking by column average. The observations in our synthetic data simulation suggest that ranking by column average is the best choice because of its interpretability and performance. Below we report the performance of alternative ranking methods on portfolios built with the top quantile of stocks in market capitalization on each trading day, which is the same data as that used to construct the portfolios reported in Panel A of Table 1.

Panels A, B, C of table 10 show the results for data-driven portfolios when leaders and followers are identified with SpringRank, Serial Ranking, and SyncRank, respectively. 40Table 10 shows that lead-lag relationships identified by the data-driven methods presented in this paper are robust under various ranking methods. While there is a difference between the results of Table 10 and Table 1, the portfolios still remain economically significant. Portfolio performances using SpringRank are similar to the results in Table 1, while the results for Serial Ranking and SyncRank are not as good as those reported in Table 1 where the assets are ranked by column average. This is consistent with the results in the synthetic data simulations where SyncRank and Serial ranking are deemed less efficient than SpringRank and column average ranking in identifying lead-lag relationships.",

Pearson 21, 08 034 Barcelona, Spain Tel: +34 93 253 4200, Fax: +34 93 253 4343, Email: jestrada@ies e.edu Abstract The most important financial issue retirees have to deal with is whether thei r strategy will be able to sustain all the withdrawals they expect to make in retirement, as well as a bequest they aim to leave. For this reason, it is critical to periodica lly monitor the evolution of a financial plan in order to detect early signs of trouble, which may lead a retiree to introduce dynamic adjustments to a strategy. To that purpose, this article features tw o tools, a sustainability test and the sustainable withdrawal, and shows how to apply them. It also discusses the empirical evidence on both tools based on a comprehensive sample of 22 countries over a 120-year period . February, 2021 1. Introduction The sustainability of a withdrawal strategy is arguably the mo st important financial issue t h a t r e t i r e e s h a v e t o d e a l w i t h . I f t h e w i t h d r a w a l s n e e d e d t o s ustain a desired lifestyle and bequest are not consistent with a retiree\u2019s portfolio and its e xpected return, given the retiree\u2019s life expectancy, then something must adjust. In fact, the ultim ate goal of a financial plan should be to ensure that the withdrawal s planned for the retirement ye ars, including a target bequest, are consistent with a portfolio\u2019s capacity to satisfy them. Bengen\u2019s (1994) seminal article on safe withdrawal rates inspi red a massive literature that debates his 4% rule as well as many other withdrawal strat egies subsequently proposed.1 Ultimately, Bengen aimed to high light the importance of impleme nting a withdrawal strategy that d o e s n o t d e p l e t e a p o r t f o l i o e a r l i e r t h a n a r e t i r e e p l a n n e d f o r . A strategy that is expected to sustain all the withdrawals a retiree expects to make during re tirement, as well as the bequest he aims to leave, is referred to here as a sustainable strategy. Typically, the way to evaluate the feasibility of a withdrawal strategy is to select a metric and evaluate its performance ove r a large number of historical or simulated retirement periods. For example, a strategy of withdrawing 4% from a 60-40 stock-bo nd portfolio at the beginning of retirement, followed by 29 annual inflation-adjusted withdrawal s, has a historical failure rate of less than 5% in the U.S. and over 65% in Italy. That evidence m ay lead an American investor to embrace the strategy with confid ence and an Italian investor to reject it outright. \u2217 I would like to thank Jack Rader for his comments. David Vila provided research assistance. The views expressed below and an y errors that may rema in are entirely my own. 1 The 4% rule refers to a strategy that withdraws 4% of the port folio at the beginning of retirement, and then adjusts all subsequent withd rawals by inflat ion, thus keep ing purchasing power constant over time. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=37830472 The two approaches proposed here are different from that in th e previous example in a critical way: They both aim to be dynamic and forward looking i n the sense that a retiree can use them during retirement to periodically evaluate whether the withdrawal strategy implemented is sustainable (the sustainability test); or to periodically determine a sustainable level of inflation- adjusted withdrawals ( the sustainable withdrawal). Importantly, both the sustainability of the strategy and the sustainable wit hdrawal can, and most likely wi ll, change from period to period depending on the performance o f the retirement portfolio.",

        "content": "To be sure, this article does not aim to develop an optimal wi thdrawal strategy. Rather, it a i m s t o p r o v i d e r e t i r e e s a n d t h e i r a d v i s o r s w i t h t w o t o o l s t h e y c a n u s e p e r i o d i c a l l y d u r i n g retirement: One to calculate the sustainability of whatever wit hdrawal strategy they have chosen to implement; and another to ca lculate a sustainable level of i nflation-adjusted withdrawals, which could be compared to whatever withdrawals they have chose n to make. Both tools, the sustainability test and the sustainable withdrawal, can be used a s a s i g n a l t o c o n s i d e r t h e introduction of dynamic adjustme nts aimed at reducing the proba bility of failure. This article also explores the evidence, using a sample of 22 markets over 120 years, on the sustainability of different strategies and on sustainable w ithdrawals. The tables in the text and the appendix provide a compr ehensive historical perspective on several variab les related to both issues. In a nutshell, the following are some relevant res ults that stem from the evidence. F i r s t , a n d p e r h a p s u n s u r p r i s i n g l y , b o t h f a i l u r e r a t e s a n d u n s u s tainability rates differ widely across countries; both rates also differ widely, for any given country, across initial withdrawal rates and asset allocations. Second, sustainable withdrawals va ry widely over time, across asset allocations, and across countries; the variability over time, i n particular, renders the periodic level of sustainable withdrawals an im plausible withdrawal strategy. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 mot ivates the two tools featured here, the sustainability test and the sustainable withdrawal, w ith an example based on a global portfolio of stocks and bonds; i ntroduces the analytical framew ork; and discusses some related literature. Section 3 discusses the evidence for the 22 markets i n t h e s a m p l e , w i t h s p e c i a l emphasis on the World market and the U.S. market. Finally, sect ion 4 concludes with an assessment. An appendix with tables concludes the article. 2. The Issue This section first discusses th e intuition behind the two tool s featured in this article, the sustainability test and the sustainable withdrawal, with an exa mple based on a portfolio of global stocks and bonds. Then it discusses both tools formally, introd ucing the expressions needed to implement them. And finally, it discusses some relevant insight s f r o m t h e l i t e r a t u r e o n t h e evaluation of withdrawal strategies. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=37830473 2.1. Motivation Just as important as having a good retirement plan is monitori ng periodically whether the plan remains on track. Because the actual returns experienced b y a retiree hardly ever will be those expected in the plan, it i s critical to evaluate over tim e whether the plan remains feasible. This is precisely what the first tool featured in this article aims to do. Exhibit 1 shows the evolution of four portfolios ( P), all starting with $1,000; with a 60-40 allocation to globally-diversifi ed stocks and bonds (essentiall y, the World market in both asset classes), with an expected annuali zed real return of 4.2%; and subject to 30 annual withdrawals. All figures in the exhibit are i n real (inflation-adjusted) dol lars. Panels A through C are based on a 4% initial withdrawal rate (IW R), followed by 29 annual infla tion-adjusted withdrawals.",

The second column of panel A shows the first tool featured her e, the sustainability test. In words, this test asks, at the beginning of each year in retirem ent, what is the expected bequest (B), given a sequence of annual inflation-adjusted withdrawals fr om that point on, and given the size (and expected return) of the portfolio at that point. As l ong as the expected bequest is not negative ( B \u2265 0), then the strategy is sust ainable; that is, it is expecte d to sustain all the withdrawals planned. The expression used to calculate B is discussed in the next section. Panel B, based on the 1929-1958 retirement period, illustrates that it is possible for a strategy to become unsustainable, as it happens in period 3 ( B = \u2013$235 < 0), but eventually become sustainable again, as it happens in period 4. To elabora te, the situation at some point during retirement may be such that the strategy is expected to fail, but subsequent strong returns make the strategy feasible again.",

        "content": "In this particular case, the strategy becomes sustainable again just one year after it first became unsustainable, even though the retiree did not adjust his withdrawals in response to the signal from the sustainability t est (that is, he still withdrew $40). Panel C, on the other hand, based on the 1914-1943 retirement period, illustrates that it i s a l s o p o s s i b l e f o r a s t r a t e g y t o b e c o m e u n s u s t a i n a b l e ( a s i t happens in period 4), to never become sustainable again, and to eventually fail (as it happens in period 18). Unlike the previous case, in which ignoring the sign al from the sustainability test still enabled the retiree to make it through the end of his retirement and leave a bequest, in this case ignoring the signal and not adjusting the withdrawals eventually leads to portfolio failure . Panels B and C highlight that a strategy deemed to be unsustai nable may or may not lead to portfolio failure. Put differently, failing the sustainabili ty test provides a warning signal that a retiree may or may not decide to act upon. Cautious retirees ma y adjust their strategy right away, or at least keep a close eye on sustainability in the near futu re; more adventurous retirees, on the other hand, may refrain from adjusting their strategy and hope for a good run of returns that may restore the sustainabili ty of their portfolio. Finally, panel D, based on the 1990-2019 retirement period, il lustrates the second tool featured in this article, the sustainable withdrawal ( WS). The first column of the panel shows the evolution of the portfolio, which by design should end with an amount equal to the target bequest, which in this case is $0. The second column shows the sustainab le withdrawal; that is, the level of inflation-adjusted annual withdrawals that, given the size ( and expected return) of the portfolio at the beginning of each period, leaves the target be quest at the end of retirement. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=37830475 To illustrate, in period 15 the retiree has an $813 portfolio. Thus, if over the 15 years left in his retirement he withdraws a n inflation-adjusted $71 every year, and his portfolio obtains its (4.2%) expected return every yea r, he will exhaust his portfoli o b y t h e e n d o f 3 0 y e a r s , t h u s l e a v i n g h i s t a r g e t b e q u e s t ( $ 0 i n t h i s c a s e ) .

The expression used to calculate WS is discussed in the next section. That said, the sustainable withdrawal can help a retiree to ev aluate how much he may need to adjust his withdrawals if his strategy is deemed to be unsustainable. To illustrate, if the sustainability test determines that a strategy of withdrawing ( s a y ) $ 5 0 e v e r y y e a r i s unsustainable, and the sustainable withdrawal calculated is (sa y) $51, then the retiree may hope that future returns are somewhat higher than he expects and ref rain from adjusting his strategy.",

Formal Background This section borrows from the an alytical framework developed b y Estrada (2020 c). 2 The analysis is based on a retirement portfolio P with an expected annualized real return R, a T-year retirement period, and T annual inflation-adjusted withdrawals ( W) made at the beginning of each of the T years in retirement. After the last withdrawal, the portfolio compounds for one more year and its terminal value becomes the bequest ( B). Formally, at each time t the relationship between the portfolio, its expec ted return, the withdrawals, an d the bequest is given by \ud835\udc35 \u0be7=\ud835\udc43 \u0be7\u2219(1+\ud835\udc45 )\u0bcd\u0b3f\u0be7+\ud835\udc4a\u2219 (1+\ud835\udc45 )\u2219\u1240\u0b35\u0b3f(\u0b35\u0b3e\u0bcb )\u0cc5\u0c37\u0cdf \u0bcb\u1241 ( 1 ) This expression yields the expected bequest and is the basis fo r the sustainability test; as long as the calculated value is not negative ( Bt \u2265 0), the strategy evaluated is deemed to be sustainable at the time ( t) the evaluation is made. To illustrate, in panel A of Exhibit 1, at the end of the tent h year in retirement, with a $1,377 portfolio, an expected real return of 4.2%, and 20 infla tion-adjusted withdrawals of $40 to be made, the expected bequest is equal to \ud835\udc35 \u0b35\u0b34= $1,377 \u2219 (1 + 0.042 )(\u0b37\u0b34\u0b3f\u0b35\u0b34)+$ 4 0\u2219 (1 + 0.042 )\u2219\u1240\u0b35\u0b3f(\u0b35\u0b3e\u0b34.\u0b34\u0b38\u0b36 )(\u0c2f\u0c2c\u0c37\u0c2d\u0c2c) \u0b34.\u0b34\u0b38\u0b36\u1241= $1,868 2 That framework, in turn, borrows from the analytical framework s developed in Estrada (2019, 2020 a, 2020 b) for the accumulation period, t he withdrawal pe riod, and the l ifecycle.

Expressions (1)-(2) are the backbone of the two tools featured here. The former aims to periodically evaluate the sustainability of a withdrawal strate gy, and the latter aims to periodically calculate the susta inable level of inflation-adjus ted withdrawals. Importantly, both are expected to change over time depending on the value of the portfolio and the number of years left in retirement.

Although the sustainability test and the sustainable withdrawal featured here are not really evaluation me trics, a historical (or simula tion-based) perspective of their values, as that provided in section 3, can help to evaluate the feasibility of a withdrawal strategy. The literature on the evaluation of retirement strategies begi ns with Bengen\u2019s (1994) seminal article, in which he aims to determine a safe withdrawa l rate. He finds that an IWR of 4%, with subsequent annual withdrawa ls adjusted by inflation, is sa fe in the sense that (historically) i t n e v e r d e p l e t e d a b a l a n c e d p o r t f o l i o b e f o r e 3 0 y e a r s , w h i c h h e considered a minimum requirement for portfolio longev ity.

Regarding evaluation metrics, it is important to note that how ever intuitive and widely used it may be, the failure rate is flawed in more than one way (Milevsky, 2016), which has led to the development of several alternatives. Blanchett (2007) propo sed the success-to-variability ratio; Blanchett et al (2012) pro posed the sustainable spending rate; Suarez et al (2015) and Clare et al (2017) proposed the perfec t withdrawal amount; Estrada (2 017, 2018 a, 2018 b, 2018 c) proposed shortfall years, risk-ad justed success, the maximum wi thdrawal rate, and downside risk-adjusted success; a nd Estrada and Kritzman (2019) proposed the coverage ratio. Frank and Blanchett (2010) are perhaps the closest reference t o the issues discussed in this article. Although they propose a different metric (the pro bability of failure), their ultimate goal is, as it is here, to evaluate periodically during retirement whether a given strategy will be able to meet all the withdrawals and bequest contemplated in a financial plan. 3. Evidence This section first discusses th e data and methodology used in the empirical inquiry. Then it discusses the historical sustainability of withdrawal strate gies (based on different IWRs and asset allocations) and historical levels of sustainable withdra wals, for all the markets in the sample. Finally, it concludes with some rounding comments on th e analysis. 3.1. Data and Methodology The sample is the Dimson-Marsh-Staunton (DMS) database, descri bed in detail in Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (2002) and i n the annual updates of the dat abase documentation. It contains annual returns for stocks and government bonds over the 1900-20 19 period for 21 countries and the World market. Returns are real (adjusted by each country\u2019s inflation rate), in local currency, and account for both capital gains/losses and cash flows (divid ends or coupons). Real returns for the World market are in dollars and adjusted by the U.S. inflat ion rate. Exhibit A1 in the appendix reports some summary statistics for all the series of stock and bond returns in the sample. The analysis is based on a portfolio of 1,000 units of local c urrency at the beginning of retirement, a 30-year retirement period, and 30 annual withdraw als made at the beginning of each year in retirement. After the last withdrawal the portfoli o compounds for one more year and its terminal value becomes the b equest. All returns and portfol io values are expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms. The first retirement period conside red is 1900-1929 and the last one is 1990-2019, for a total of 91 rolling (overlapping) retiremen t periods.",

The Sustainability Te st \u2013 Sensitivity Analysis Exhibit 3 expands the previous analysis, based on a 60-40 stoc k-bond portfolio and a 4% IWR, to several asset allocations and IWRs, for both the World and the U.S. Unsurprisingly, for both markets it is the case that, all else equal, higher IWRs a nd more conservative asset allocations lead to higher failur e rates and unsustainability r ates. IWRs 5% or higher have what most retirees would consider unacc eptable failure rates and unsustainability rates, even for aggressive portfolios. For the 80-20 allocation, a 5% IWR has a failure rate higher than 36% in the World and just under 30% in the U.S. For the same allocation and IWR, the unsustainability rate is over 58% in the World and over 46% in the U.S. In both m a r k e t s , t h e s t r a t e g y f i r s t b e c a m e u n s u s t a i n a b l e 6 t o 7 y e a r s i nto retirement, requiring a decrease in withdrawals of at least 10% about half the time (ov er 50% in the World and over 45% in the U.S.) in order to restore sustainability.

For example, just moving from a 40-60 to a 60-40 stock-bond portfolio would enable a retiree to increase his average sustainable withdrawal by almost 8% in the World and by over 10% in the U.S. Because the whole analysis is based on real returns, these figures imply an increase by the same amounts in purchasing power throughout retirement. Exhibit A3 in the appendix reports a similar analysis for the rest of the countries in the sample. As in Exhibit A2, the results are many and varied. Perh aps an interesting result to highlight is that countries highlighted before as having provid ed a better experience for retirees (Canada, Denmark, and New Zealand) have a relatively small gap between the Min and Max sustainable withdrawals, implying less difference between good and bad retirement periods. On the other hand, countries highli ghted before as having provided a worse experience for retirees (Austria, Germany, and Italy), have a much larger Min-Max gap, indicating the opposite. 3.5. Some Further Comments The framework proposed in this article could be used by retire es and financial planners to periodically evaluate the sustainability of a financial plan during retirement. Because plans hardly ever develop as expected, this dynamic evaluation is cri tical to determine whether it is necessary to introduce adjustments aimed at restoring the viabi lity of a plan. Estrada (2020 a) shows that when adjustments need to be made, it is better to ad just withdrawals than to adjust the portfolio\u2019s asset allocation; that result applies to the is sues discussed in this article. T he analytical framework summarized by ex pressions (1)-(2) is based on an expected annualized return for the portfolio, which in the empirical imp lementation was set equal to the annualized historical return of the asset allocation considered . Needless to say, this figure could be replaced by whatever expected return a retiree considers mor e plausible. It could also be Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=378304712 replaced by sequences of (Monte Carlo) simulated returns, altho ugh that would imply changes in expressions (1)-(2) that would make them more cumbersome. Finally, although part of the analysis is based on inflation-a djusted withdrawals that aim to keep purchasing power constant over time, this could be repl aced by other policies, including dynamic strategies that periodically adjust withdrawals. The pr ice to pay again would be having to deal with expressions more co mplicated than those discussed here. 4.",

A f i n a n c i a l p l a n certainly helps to alleviate this concern, albeit not completel y for a simple reason, namely, these plans never go as expected. For this reason, as retirement unfo l d s , r e t i r e e s w o u l d b e w i s e t o evaluate the sustainability of t heir plan and consider whether adjustments need to be made. To that purpose, this article offers retirees and financial pl anners two tools, the sustainability test and the sustainable withdrawal. The former can be used to periodically test whether the strategy in place is expected to sustain all the wi thdrawals and bequest planned; the latter can be used to periodically determine the inflation-adju sted withdrawal that is expected to leave the retirement portfolio w ith the target bequest. Unlike other evaluation tools, such as the failure rate, these tw o tools can be used during retirement for periodic evaluations. This article also provides an empirical perspective on both to ols, using a comprehensive database of 22 countries over a 1 20-year sample period. For a b ase case consisting of a balanced 6 0 - 4 0 s t o c k - b o n d p o r t f o l i o a n d a 4 % i n i t i a l w i t h d r a w a l r a t e , t h e evidence shows, on average across all the countries in the s a m p l e , a f a i l u r e r a t e o f 3 0 . 7 % and an unsustainability rate of 51.5%. Needless to say, these fi gures vary considerably across countries, as they do across initial withdrawal rates and asset allocations. T h e e v i d e n c e a l s o s h o w s t h a t t h e base-case strategy first beco mes unsustainable on average 8 years into the retirement period, and that in 47.6% ( 19.2%) of those times the decrease in withdrawals that would restore sustainability is at least as large as 10% (20%). It also shows that retirees in some countries had much better experiences tha n those in other countries, and that the former also had to bear less uncertainty as measured b y the difference between good and bad retirement periods. Retirees should always keep in mind that plans are unlikely to work as expected and that adjustments may need to be made along way. The only way to dete ct departures from what was planned is to periodically monitor a financial plan using tools t h a t p r o v i d e a n e a r l y s i g n a l o f t r o u b l e d o w n t h e r o a d . T h e t w o t o o l s f e a t u r e d i n t h i s a r t i c l e c an hopefully help retirees and financial planners to deal with this problem.

Andreou\u2020\u2021 So\ufb01a Anyfantaki\u00a7 November 15, 2020 Abstract This paper presents the survey results for \ufb01nancial literacy among Cypriot adults and re- ports their \ufb01nancial aptitude and behaviour. Additionally, it investigates for the \ufb01rst time the implications of \ufb01nancial literacy on respondents\u2019 usage of digital \ufb01nancial services, particularly internet banking (i-banking). The focus is on Cyprus, a country that experienced an unprece- dented \ufb01nancial crisis in 2013 that resulted in a bail-in and an enormous subsequent shrinkage of the banking sector. Cypriot consumers face an ever-increasing need for \ufb01nancial sophistica- tion to e\ufb00ectively utilise and manage digital banking services. Neverthless, \ufb01nancial literacy is still low in Cyprus, whereby only 37.33% of survey respondents showed pro\ufb01ciency in \ufb01nancial knowledge. The \ufb01ndings indicate that there is a statistically positive relationship between the levels of \ufb01nancial knowledge and the frequency of i-banking use. More importantly, \ufb01nancially illiterate consumers appear to report - far more often than their \ufb01nancially literate peers - the lack of trust in i-banking, as well as a lack of self-con\ufb01dence in \ufb01nancial and digital skills as the main reasons for not using this service. The \ufb01ndings highlight the interplay between \ufb01nancial literacy and digital pro\ufb01ciency, and their implication on individuals\u2019 use of i-banking services.

The importance of \ufb01nancial literacy, including its positive externalities - such as better \ufb01nancial decision making- is substantiated by a growing body of studies. Individuals with a higher level of \ufb01nancial literacy are less vulnerable to being exploited or deceived (Campbell et al., 2011; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011; Deevy et al., 2012; de Bassa Scheresberg, 2013; Balloch et al., 2015; Andreou and Philip, 2018), less prone to over-indebtedness (Lusardi and Tufano, 2015; Andreou and Philip, 2018), betteratretirementplanning(LusardiandMitchell, 2007; vanRooijetal., 2012), participate more often in \ufb01nancial markets (van Rooij et al., 2011; Balloch et al., 2015) and have higher returns on savings accounts (Deu\ufb02hard et al., 2018). Despite the long list of studies on \ufb01nancial literacy, an in-depth analysis of the relationship between \ufb01nancial literacy and consumer use of digital \ufb01nancial services such as i-banking remains a notable gap in the literature. The contribution of this paper is thus twofold: \ufb01rst, it investigates the level and scope of \ufb01nancial literacy among various socio-demographic characteristics in Cyprus. Second, the paper o\ufb00ers novel evidence by investigating the extent to which i-banking behaviour is in\ufb02uenced by variations in \ufb01nancial literacy levels. In general, Cyprus has not come close to matching the range and depth of studies, as far as adult population is concerned, conducted in other European countries investigating \ufb01nancial literacy and its implications.",

        "content": "To \ufb01ll this void, this paper extends Andreou and Philips (2018) study and exploits data from Cyprus using survey responses from 600 adults aged between 25 and 65, where the overwhelming majority holds a bank account. The results show that \ufb01nancial knowledge pro\ufb01ciency, measured as the average score of correct answers to six questions that span economic concepts in the \u201csaving, portfolio and mortgage\u201d choice domain, is rather low among Cypriots. Speci\ufb01cally, only 37.33% of the respondents answered at least four questions correctly, which is the minimum target level, with females showing much lower levels of \ufb01nancial knowledge (a gender gap of around 10%). This places Cyprus below the OECD country average that stands at around 62% (OECD, 2016, p. 26) and well below from leading countries in the \ufb01nancial literacy domain, like Estonia (73%), Finland (70%) and Latvia (68%).2The rather low \ufb01nancial knowledge score in Cyprus can be also corroborated by evidence from international surveys (e.g. Demirguc-Kunt et al., 2015). Consequently, individuals appear to be ill-equipped to participate in today\u2019s complex (and digitalised) \ufb01nancial sector. Further, the 10% gender gap compares unfavourably to the corresponding of 5% across major emerging economies (Hasler and Lusardi, 2017). Withonly30.03%ofthegroupcharacterisedas\ufb01nancialliterate, theresultspointto, individuals aged 39 or under -millennials - as individuals with a higher probability of showing low levels of 1According to the European Banking Federation, the number of branches across the EU-28 decreased by 5.6% in 2018 relative to the previous year, re\ufb02ecting the increasing interaction of consumers with banks through digital channels. Furthermore, according to Eurostat, 58% of individuals in the EU-28 used i-banking in 2019 (up from 32% in 2009). 2The \ufb01nancial knowledge scores of this study cannot be strictly compared to evidence from the OECD (2016) due to the studies\u2019 dissimilarities in survey questions and designs. 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104\ufb01nancial knowledge. This result squares with other recent empirical evidence. For example, Lusardi et al. (2018) show that millennials know little about their student loans and many do not attempt to calculate their future loan payment amounts. Andreou and Philip (2018) show that Cypriot university students, mostly aged 18 to 24, also exhibit low levels of \ufb01nancial literacy: most fail to e\ufb00ectively manage credit card debt and tend to be more susceptible to \ufb01nancial fraud. These \ufb01ndings point to a need for the inclusion of \ufb01nancial education programmes in national strategy and policy making: \u201cYoung people can\u2019t a\ufb00ord to make \ufb01nancial mistakes.... [hence] \ufb01nancial education is an important part for their \ufb01nancial empowerment\u201d .3 The study reveals that \ufb01nancial literacy is an important channel of in\ufb02uence on i-banking behaviour, above various other important socio-demographics, skills and traits. Interestingly, those lacking \ufb01nancial knowledge are also more likely to report a corresponding lack of information technology skills, banking-speci\ufb01c knowledge, and con\ufb01dence, as reasons for not using i-banking. The latter points to the co-existence of \ufb01nancial illiteracy and absence of digital know-how, i.e. digital \ufb01nancial illiteracy . The OECD (2018) highlights digital \ufb01nancial literacy as an important component of the global policymaking agenda, but does not provide an explicit de\ufb01nition of the term. In a recent policy brief, Morgan et al. (2019) discuss four important dimensions that a de\ufb01nition should encompass: knowledge of digital \ufb01nancial products and services; experience in using digital \ufb01nancial products and services; awareness of digital \ufb01nancial risks; and skill in controlling and managing \ufb01nancial digital activities. In the absence of a standardised de\ufb01nition, we perceive digital \ufb01nancial literacy as a nexus of competencies spanning elements of \ufb01nancial literacy and digital pro\ufb01ciency, that enable individuals to maintain their \ufb01nancial wellbeing by con\ufb01dently making e\ufb00ective and responsible use of digital \ufb01nancial products and services. Digital \ufb01nancial literacy can therefore be visualised as a multidimensional concept referring to individuals\u2019 breadth and depth of \ufb01nancial knowledge and skills, enhanced by their aptitude in using products and services o\ufb00ered in a digital fashion. Conversely, within the context of our study, digital \ufb01nancial illiteracy is perceived as a lack of such knowledge, skills and aptitude, with negative consequences on individuals making use of \ufb01nancial products and services o\ufb00ered through digital platforms, such as i-banking.",

        "content": "The evidence from Cyprus complements several studies, consistently showing that, levels of \ufb01- nancial literacy are relatively low, even across advanced economies. For example, the OECD (2017) states that fewer than half of the adult population in the G20 countries is \ufb01nancially literate, and thus national policies should be oriented towards enhancing \ufb01nancial education. According to the \ufb01ndings of Standard and Poor\u2019s Rating Services Global Financial Literacy Survey (Klapper et al., 2015), \ufb01nancial literacy rates vary widely across the EU with the rates much lower in Southern Europe.

In this context, Cyprus is a very interesting case and o\ufb00ers important insights to the extant literature. First, it was among the European countries hit hardest during the economic and banking crisis of 2013. Although the crisis in Cyprus shared similar earlier macroeconomic imbalances with other crisis-hit South European countries, it was di\ufb00erent in nature and led to an unexpected bail-in.4Against this background and in the wake of the economic turmoil that followed in the period 2014-2017, the important question thus arises whether Cypriot consumers have signi\ufb01cantly stepped up their e\ufb00orts to improve their \ufb01nancial literacy levels in line with other leading European countries. This kind of spill-over e\ufb00ect is motivated by evidence showing that people are learning through experience, especially when it adversely a\ufb00ects their \ufb01nancial wellbeing (Lusardi, 2009; OECD, 2009). Second, a large consolidation process is taking place in the banking sector. Cypriot banks, in an endeavour to achieve economies of scale by downsizing their network, are actively encouranging their customers to avoid visiting the branches, and instead carry out transactions through i-banking platforms. In fact, the number of branches has fallen drastically over the past few years, and as such, consumers in Cyprus face an ever-increasing need for \ufb01nancial and digital sophistication to make informed \ufb01nancial decisions. While empirical studies (see, for example, Calvet et al., 2007; Klapper et al., 2013; Lussardi and Tufano, 2015) have alluded to the bene\ufb01ts of \ufb01nancial literacy in terms of making prudent \ufb01nancial decisions, the evidence of Cyprus highlights that \ufb01nancial literacy is instrumental for the e\ufb00ective and responsible use of digital \ufb01nancial products. A rather surprising result of this study is that, almost a decade after the banking crisis and while new technologies continue to disrupt the \ufb01nancial industry, Cyprus\u2019 \ufb01nancial literacy level (and pro\ufb01ciency in using digital services) remains low compared to its European peers, for exam- ple Denmark, Norway and Estonia.5This evidence could convey two important, yet worrisome, takeaways. First, the crisis in Cyprus has revealed many fault lines, with far too many people having faced real hardship. Despite households in Cyprus experiencing severe economic repercussions from the crisis and a resulting expectation that more e\ufb00ort would be expended to enhance the \ufb01nancial literacy of the population, the results of this survey indicate that \ufb01nancial literacy has remained low. Financial education plays an important role in preparing people to face economic challenges and in equipping individuals to deal with macroeconomic shocks (Klapper et al., 2013). 4For an overview of the Cypriot crisis see Clerides (2014), Michaelides (2016), Orphanides (2016) and Zenios (2016). 5These particular countries are also those that appear to rank relatively high in the dimensions that are marked as key in the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report.",

Second, the evidence from Cyprus indicates that, amongst other negative factors, \ufb01nancial illiteracy could be holding consumers back from the broad adoption of \ufb01nancial innovations, of which i-banking is an example. The study shows that, while Cyprus is rapidly transitioning to digital banking systems - which o\ufb00er households a broader set of opportunities and encourage them to adopt electronic channels such as i-banking - \ufb01nancial literacy is still lagging behind. Hence, this could be used as evidence that digital \ufb01nancial illiteracy is a looming threat to the \ufb01nancial inclusion of individuals in the new age of digital banking. Given the above, the \ufb01ndings of this study have key implications and provide ample material for policy design. Financial literacy is in fact becoming increasingly important and elevating \ufb01nan- cial literacy levels - in combination with improving consumers\u2019 digital pro\ufb01ciency to enable them address the emerging issues pertaining to the digitalisation of \ufb01nancial products - has been set as a top priority for policy makers internationally.6The OECD/INFE, for example, has released \u201cDig- italization and Financial Literacy\u201d, a policy guidance, endorsed by the G20 in 2018 that \u201cprovides policy makers with tools to help economies and societies prosper in an increasingly digital and data-driven world\u201d (OECD, 2018). In this regard, the evidence from Cyprus can facilitate existing policy directions: education programmes on digital \ufb01nance should be a central element in national \ufb01nancial literacy strategies, with a focus to enhance consumers\u2019 skills likely to be critical in the digital age, including special programmes for vulnerable groups. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the Cypriot environment and reviews some recent evidence on \ufb01nancial literacy in Cyprus. Section 3 discusses the design of the research. Section 4 presents some \ufb01ndings about the levels of \ufb01nancial literacy and Section 5 focuses on i-banking behaviour. Section 6 draws conclusions and o\ufb00ers policy suggestions. 2 Background 2.1 The unique banking environment in Cyprus The special social and economic characteristics of Cyprus qualify the country as a prominent case of investigation across EU countries. First, Cyprus is one of the smallest countries in the EU, with a population of 864,234, that is relatively highly educatied. According to Eurostat, tertiary education attainment reached a record high of 57.1% in 2018; far above the EU-28 average (40.7%). Second, the \ufb01nancial sector has played a dominant role in the Cypriot economy. Speci\ufb01cally, according to the Central Bank of Cyprus, total banking sector assets rose from \u20ac50 billion or 340% of GDP at the end of 2005, to about \u20ac128 billion or 688% of GDP at the end of the second quarter of 2010. By the end of 2012 and with the banking crisis looming ahead, total assets had dropped to \u20ac105 billion or 540% of GDP.7Following 6In2016, theG20leadersendorsedthe High-level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion , whichincludePrinciple 6 to \u201cStrengthen Digital and Financial Literacy and Awareness\u201d (GPFI, 2016). 7https://www.centralbank.cy/en/publications/monetary-and-\ufb01nancial-statistics 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104a period of strong economic growth, in 2013, Cyprus experienced a major banking crisis that was unprecedented in scale and caused a meltdown of the economy.8Cyprus was the \ufb01rst Eurozone country ever to apply capital controls in March of 2013, with limits on credit card transactions, daily withdrawals and overseas money transfers. Since then, the Cypriot banking system has undergone considerable transformation leading to an enormous downsizing. For example, according to Central Bank of Cyprus, at the end of the third quarter 2016, total assets had dropped to \u20ac68 billion or 386% of GDP - loans to monetary and \ufb01nancial institutions (MFIs) excluded - while this \ufb01gure dropped below 320% of GDP in 2018.",

        "content": "In 2019, there were 30 authorised credit institutions in Cyprus: seven local institutions, three subsidiaries of foreign credit institutions from EU member states, one subsidiary of a foreign credit institution from a non-EU country, \ufb01ve branches of credit institutions from EU member states, 13 branches of credit institutions from non-EU member states and one representative o\ufb03ce.9At the end of 2018, there were 352 branches in Cyprus, compared to 502 in 2016, a drastic drop of about 30%. The most recent development in the banking sector, was the shutting down of the state-owned Cooperative Central Bank in August 2018, which lead to an even greater reduction in the number of branches. The recent Cyrpus banking crisis has had multiple negative e\ufb00ects, including crippling the economy and severely damaging the country\u2019s banking sector (Brown et al., 2018). Cypriots tend to take a great deal of debt and despite the ongoing deleveraging process, household debt in Q1 2020 amounted to \u20ac20.2 billion or 92% of GDP. To date, Cyprus also has one of the highest non- performing loan ratios in the EU (27.8% in April 2020). Although there are di\ufb00erent views about the relative importance of the contributing factors, it is generally accepted that the banking crisis in Cyprus stemmed from a combination of errors and omissions, as well as risky and improper be- haviour by various players (Clerides, 2014). Financial literacy can help people better manage their \ufb01nances through times of hardship and bu\ufb00er themselves against \ufb01nancial emergencies. Whilst \ufb01nancial illiteracy was not necessarily the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for the Cyprus banking crisis, a lack of understanding of essential \ufb01nancial issues and the absence of personal \ufb01nancial responsibility un- doubttedly contributed to the crisis at least to some extent, a linkage that has also been identi\ufb01ed in similar crisis situations in other countries (OECD, 2009). 2.2 Use of i-banking and \ufb01nancial literacy in Cyprus The penetration of i-banking has been steadily increasing in Cyprus over recent years, although it still lags behind the EU average; indeed, it is one of the lowest shares. According to Eurostat, in 2018, 38% of individuals between 25 and 64 years old in Cyprus used i-banking (EU average 59%) compared to 18% in 2009 (EU average 36%). I-banking is particularly popular among 25-34 8According to the Cyprus Statistical Service, in 2008, GDP growth exhibited a slow deceleration reaching a growth rate of 3.7%, while in 2009, GDP registered a signi\ufb01cant contraction of 2.0%. Subsequently, signs of recovery were recorded in 2010, where GDP growth reached 1.4% and in 2011, the economy recorded a marginal growth of 0.4%. The growth rate of the GDP plunged to -2.4% and -5.9% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. 9https://www.centralbank.cy/en/licensing-supervision/banks/register-of-credit-institutions-operating-in-cyprus 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104years-olds, with 50% using this facility. Its use tends to increase in line with the education level of the user: while only 5% of individuals 25 to 64 years old with a low education level use i-banking, 67% with a high level of education use this service. In 2019, Cyprus ranked overall 22nd among the EU-28 on the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), while in the \u201chuman capital\u201d dimension of the index, Cyprus ranked 24th. Although Cypriots increasingly go online, their level of basic and advanced digital skills remains below the EU-28 average and the same holds for their usage of internet services. Overall, Cypriots are keen to engage in a variety of online activities and they are active internet users, but they still lag behind EU-28 average. Evidence also suggests that Cypriots\u2019 overall \ufb01nancial literacy level is low. An early survey was conducted by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) in 2010,10which covered individuals over 22 years old, but focused only on general knowledge and information issues related to the capital market, investments in securities and investment products. As such, the primary goal of the survey was not to measure \ufb01nancial literacy levels, but rather to identify participants\u2019 level of awareness and knowledge on concepts related to CySEC\u2019s agenda. As a result, the survey was neither informative nor conclusive regarding the country\u2019s \ufb01nancial literacy level. Later, in 2014, Cyprus participated in Standard and Poor\u2019s global \ufb01nancial literacy survey.",

How much would be in the account at the end of the \ufb01rst year, once the interest payment is made? \u201d); (ii) understanding of in\ufb02ation ( \u201cHigh in\ufb02ation means that the cost of living is increasing rapidly \u201d); and, (iii) understanding of risk and return ( \u201cIf someone o\ufb00ers you the chance to make a lot of money it is likely that there is also a chance that you will lose a lot of money \u201d). 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=34991043 Research framework 3.1 Questionnaire design To achieve the research objectives, a survey was conducted using an instrument developed by the authors. The questionnaire was administered in October 2018 to Cypriot individuals (aged 25 to 65) via telephone calls conducted by the market research organisation, Insights Market Research (IMR Cyprus).12 ,13 Despite best e\ufb00orts, any measure of \ufb01nancial literacy is likely to be a\ufb00ected by measurement error: people may misunderstand a question, for example, especially when they are read out over a call. To evaluate these potential problems, a procedure was followed so that questions had a logical \ufb02ow and appropriate wording, as well as to ensure construction validity of the questionnaire. Early drafts of the survey instrument were extensively discussed with and evaluated by an experienced scholar. IMR Cyprus then made further suggestions to the \ufb02ow and phrasing of the questions. Finally, to assess validity, the survey instrument was pilot-tested with 12 individuals through a telephone interview; random digital dialing was used and the individuals were not remunerated. This ensured that the wording of the questions was comprehensible and that respondents could provide their answers within a reasonable timeframe.

IMR Cyrpus was responsible for conducting the survey and provided vital support to the authors for the completion of the \ufb01eldwork to collect the data. The authors are the sole responsible for the academic research and analysis of the data. 13The average length of a telephone survey was 20 minutes and random digit dialling was used. There is evidence to suggest that self-administered, web-based surveys may provide more accurate results compared to an interviewer- administeredapproach(ChangandKrosnick, 2009). WefollowtheOECDINFE(2011)guidancenotestousepersonal interviews for the collection of internationally comparable data of \ufb01nancial literacy (see among others, Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011). Acknowledging the limitations of telephone surveys, this method has been extensively used in the literature for \ufb01nancial literacy (see, for example, Standard and Poor\u2019s Rating Services Global Financial Literacy Survey (Klapper et al., 2015)). 14Q1 and Q2 feature multiple choice answers including \u201cDon\u2019t Know / Don\u2019t Answer\u201d to dissuade respondents from guessing. Q6 is open-ended, which allows respondents to answer in their own words (also allowing for \u201cDon\u2019t Know / Don\u2019t Answer\u201d). The remaining questions (Q3, Q4 and Q5) require a true or false response (again allowing for \u201cDon\u2019t Know / Don\u2019t Answer\u201d). 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104[Insert Table 1, here] Individuals who fail to answer Q1 and Q2 correctly will likely experience di\ufb03culties when facing basic \ufb01nancial decisions characterised by an investment today and return in the future. Providing the correct answer to Q3 requires some knowledge about stocks and mutual funds as well as the concept of risk diversi\ufb01cation, and thus indicates whether respondents can e\ufb00ectively manage their \ufb01nancial assets. The aim of Q4 and Q5 is to elicit consumers\u2019 understanding of a very important \ufb01nancial term, in this case \u201cannual percentage rate\u201d (APR). These two questions along with Q6 are banking-speci\ufb01c questions in the sense that they assume that individuals have some fundamental knowledge when they engage with \ufb01nancial institutions to receive banking services. The third section includes one multiple choice type question to identify the sources from which respondents seek \ufb01nancial advice. Recently, a lot of studies have addressed the question whether \ufb01nancialadvicemayactasasubstitutefor\ufb01nancialcapabilities, orifthesetwoshouldbeconsidered as complementary for improving a consumer\u2019s \ufb01nancial decision-making. The literature has shown that \ufb01nancial advice is mostly sought by relatively knowledgeable investors (see, for example, Hackethal et al., 2012), while less informed investors are more likely to invest without seeking advice (Collins, 2012). In the information era, internet sources and social media are new sources of information. Indeed, according to the European Commission, in 2019, Cypriots appeared to be active users of social media, with 82% using social networks, putting Cyprus in 5th place among EU countries.

The coverage target of 600 is both su\ufb03ciently large given the Cyprus population and widely used in most telephone surveys conducted by market research companies.15To ensure a nationally representative sample, the survey data were collected from a strati\ufb01ed random sample of units with known probabilities of selection from the population.16No data weighting was applied because the survey\u2019s sample is relatively well-balanced in terms of gender and age composition.17 Table 2 presents sample statistics regarding the frequency and proportion of respondents\u2019 char- acteristics tabulated across female, male and the entire sample. First, it is shown that ther are 301 female participants (accounting for 50.17% of the sample) and 299 male participants (account- ing for 49.83% of the sample). About 246 of the survey participants (41%) live in the district of Lefkosia, the capital of Cyprus, while a total of 471 (78.50%) live in an urban area. The majority of the participants hold a bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s or higher degree, while 84% come from non-business focused studies. Further, 40.17% of the sample has engaged in a relationship with at least two banks, while 69.33% of the individuals have a primary bank relationship for over seven years. The latter is reinforced by the observation that 76.33% responded not to have changed the primary bank during the last year. The table also shows that there are gender di\ufb00erences in education at the secondary school level. About 15.67% of female and 14.50% male respondents stated having a graduate education. Women and men also di\ufb00er in their use of information sources. About 22% of male sample respondents use the internet or social media as a source for \ufb01nancial advice, compared to 19% of women. [Insert Table 2, here] The notion that \ufb01nancial advice may act as a substitute for low levels of \ufb01nancial literacy rests on the assumption that less knowledgeable individuals face higher hurdles with regards to the collection and processing of information and thus, by turning to an advisor they can save on information and search costs (Georgarakos and Inderst, 2014). Internet and social media are new sources of information. In fact, as Table 2 shows, most of respondents (41.51%) seek \ufb01nancial advice through the Internet, an observation consistent for both female and male individuals. As for 15This is also the typical sample size used for Cyprus in the EU Program of Business and Con- sumerSurveys(https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/indicators-statistics/economic-databases/business- and-consumer-surveys_en). 16Up to \ufb01ve attempts were made to call the selected household. To increase the probability of contact and completion, attempts were made at di\ufb00erent times. This design resulted in a high response rate. 17A comparison between the sample and population proportions within gender-age groups shows that these are persistently below 2% for all strata. The sample slightly over-represents individuals over 40, and it under-represents young individuals. Estimation of the main \ufb01nancial literacy measures with the weighted sample shows only marginal di\ufb00erences with the unweighted one.",

Q1-Q3 (the so-called \u2019Big Three\u2019) have been widely adopted in the US and elsewhere (see, OECD, 2016)18and aim to measure \ufb01nancial literacy span- ning economic concepts in the \u201csaving and portfolio\u201d choice domain (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011). The second set of questions, Q4-Q6, are the authors\u2019 own questions designed to assess banking- related knowledge. Since the purpose of this study is to investigate the in\ufb02uence of \ufb01nancial literacy on i-banking behaviour, these questions aim to capture concepts that lie at the basis of day-to-day \ufb01nancial transactions and are related to important issues in the Cypriot banking sector, especially mortgage-related concepts that cannot solely be assessed by the Big Three questions. Hence, the addition of the three additional banking speci\ufb01c questions (Q4-Q6) to the Big Three questions (Q1- Q3), enables us to develop a comprehensive measure of \ufb01nancial literacy that spans the \u201csaving, portfolio and mortgage\u201d choice domain. Overall, the inclusion of six (instead of three) questions en- hances our capacity to di\ufb00erentiate between \ufb01nancial literacy levels, which, as suggested by Lusardi and Mitchell (2011), is a prerequisite to compare people in terms of their scores on a common set of questions. The main measure of \ufb01nancial knowledge is the average score of correct answers to the six \ufb01nancial knowledge questions of Table 1, namely FK OVERALL, whereby each correct answer takes a score of one and all others take a score of zero (OECD, 2016; Andreou and Philip, 2018). For comparison, and in order to see whether there are any di\ufb00erential e\ufb00ects between the three alternative sets of questions (Q1-Q3, Q4-Q6 and Q1-Q6), we present results separately for FK BIG3 (i.e. the average score from the respondents\u2019 correct answers to the Big Three questions Q1, Q2 and Q3) and for FK BANK (i.e. the average score from the respondents\u2019 correct answers to Q4, Q5 and Q6). Table A1 of the Online Appendix exhibits de\ufb01nitions for the three \ufb01nancial literacy measures along with other variables, which are used in this study\u2019s analyses. 4.1 Descriptive analysis The breakdown of the responses to \ufb01nancial knowledge questions regarding the frequency and proportion of \u201cCorrect\u201d, \u201cWrong\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Know / Don\u2019t Answer\u201d replies by female, male and the entire sample is reported in Table 3. Panel A shows that more than half of the respondents (350 respondents or 58.33% of the entire sample) answered correctly to the question on in\ufb02ation 18The OECD/INFE International Survey of Adult Financial Literacy Competencies (2016) questions are largely drawn from existing surveys and have all been validated and approved by OECD/INFE experts. They represent good practices in \ufb01nancial literacy and \ufb01nancial inclusion measurement. The questionnaire has been successfully used to capture the \ufb01nancial literacy of diverse populations and has been applied to more than 40 countries that participated in an international survey of adult \ufb01nancial literacy competencies. 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104(Q2) and the question on awareness of crucial banking services (Q6) (335 respondents or 55.83% of the entire sample). The percentage of correct answers to the question on understanding the composition of the annual percentage rate (Q4) is 49.67%, and to the question on the bene\ufb01ts of risk diversi\ufb01cation (Q3) is 50.67%. The compound interest rate question (Q1) and the understanding of the application of annual percentage rate (Q5) presented more of a challenge, since only 42% and 42.50% of respondents respectively could answer accurately. This evidence provides the \ufb01rst indication of reliability in our FK OVERALL instrument, as the distribution of correct answers seems to be balanced between its two composite measures, namely FK BIG3 and FK BANK. [Insert Table 3, here] Panels B, C and D of Table 3 show the number of \u201cCorrect\u201d, \u201cWrong\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Know/ Don\u2019t Answer\u201d responses for Q1-Q3 (FK BIG3), Q4-Q6 (FK BANK) and Q1-Q6 (FK OVERALL).",

        "content": "Accordingly, the number of individuals who answered correctly to Q1-Q3 is close to the number of individuals who answered correctly to Q4-Q6. The \ufb01rst question (Q1) is the one which presents the lowest frequency of correct answers, while the second and sixth questions (Q2 and Q6) are those with the highest frequencies in the entire sample. However, over the entire sample, only 32 respondents (or 5.33% of the sample) answered all the questions (Q1-Q6) correctly. Thus, individuals who answered Q1-Q3 correctly are not the same individuals as those that answered Q4-Q6 correctly, i.e. questions Q1-Q3 and Q4-Q6 capture di\ufb00erent aspects of \ufb01nancial knowledge. This pattern of responses further corroborates the reliability of our \ufb01nancial knowledge measure, since it is obvious that our own banking-related questions add information to the overall measure and are complementary to the Big Three.19The reliability of the scale of \ufb01nancial knowledge (FK OVERALL) was also assessed using Pearson pairwise correlation coe\ufb03cients for the number of correct answers to each question, along with pairwise correlation coe\ufb03cients with FK BIG3 and FK BANK (Table A2 of the Online Appendix). While the degree of \ufb01nancial literacy as measured by FK OVERALL is clearly correlated to each of the six questions forming the overall measure (coe\ufb03cients of correlation between 0.46 and 0.78), the correlation between the six questions is smaller, ranging from 0.01 to 0.29.20 In this study, following Andreou and Philip (2018), a pro\ufb01ciency in \ufb01nancial knowledge is attributed to those answering at least four out of six \ufb01nancial knowledge questions correctly.21 19Given that the numbering of the questions here does not re\ufb02ect the original numbering of the questions as they appear in the survey instrument, the above resembles a split-half reliability test where the sample is randomly split and the scores are then calculated for each half. In untabulated results, we also tried di\ufb00erent splits (for example Q1, Q3, Q5 vs.Q2, Q4, Q6) and overall it can be said that the internal consistency of the data of this study is very good. 20The number of correct answers to Q1, Q2 and Q3 are statistically correlated (coe\ufb03cients in the range 0.10 to 0.25), and the same holds true for the number of correct answers to Q4 and Q5 (coe\ufb03cient of 0.29). The number of correct answers to Q4 does not present any statistically signi\ufb01cant correlation with Q1-Q3. The number of correct answers for Q6 is strongly correlated with all other \ufb01nancial knowledge questions (coe\ufb03cients in the range 0.12 to 0.26). As for the \ufb01nancial knowledge measures: FK BIG3 and FK BANK are highly correlated with FK OVERALL (correlation coe\ufb03cients 0.780 and 0.778 respectively with p-values<0.01), while the correlation coe\ufb03cient of FK BIG3 with FK BANK is 0.214 ( p-value<0.01). 21This quanti\ufb01cation focuses on the proportion of the respondents who answered at least 67% of the questions 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104Accordingly, 37.33% of Cypriots who responded to the survey appear to have a good level of \ufb01nancial knowledge and are thus perceived to be \ufb01nancially literate individuals. Another robust \ufb01nding across many countries is the gender gap with respect to \ufb01nancial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2008; Lusardi and Tufano, 2009, 2015; Hung et al., 2009; Mottola, 2013; Bucher-Koenen et al., 2016; Agnew and Harrison, 2015; Klapper et al., 2015): men usually score higher on \ufb01nancial literacy than women. This is apparent in the distribution of correct answers to the six \ufb01nancial knowledge questions which indeed varies markedly with gender. Among those with all correct answers, only 1.67% are women, while the respective percentage for men is more than double (3.67%). Moreover, women are also much more likely to state that they cannot answer a question, which is indicative of very low levels of \ufb01nancial knowledge.22However, for the banking-related questions Q4-Q6, as captured by FK BANK, women score on average relatively well compared to men with the exception of the question on awareness of crucial banking issues (Q6), whereby 20.33% of women cannot give an answer. These results square with women\u2019s banking attitudes.",

The last column of this table reports the Pearson correlations of the variables with the main \ufb01nancial literacy score (FK OVERALL). For completeness, Table A3 of the Online Appendix reports pairwise correlation of the three \ufb01nancial literacy measures with all the variables used in our analyses. [Insert Table 4, here] As reported in Table 4, the mean values for FK BIG3, FK BANK and FK OVERALL are 0.503, 0.493 and 0.498, respectively.23Respondents aged 39 or younger (MILLENNIALS) are fewer in the sample of knowledgeable respondents; the mean di\ufb00erence stands at -0.115 ( p-value<0.01), while the Mann-Whitney test has p-value<0.01, whereby both tests con\ufb01rm other recent evidence of low correctly. In the OECD survey (2016) a minimum target score of at least \ufb01ve out of seven on the knowledge questions is employed, translating to a threshold of at least 70% of correct replies. 22Even though for the annual percentage rate questions (Q4 and Q5) the correct responses are consistent across gender, the division among correct responses becomes particularly noticeable when looking at Q1, Q2 and Q6. The gender di\ufb00erence is greater for the compound interest rate calculation question, to which female respondents are found to be 11 percentage points less likely to answer correctly and 4 percentage points more likely to indicate \u201cDon\u2019t Know.\u201d A smaller di\ufb00erence is found for the in\ufb02ation question. Here, the gender di\ufb00erence is 5 percentage points, and women are 4 percentage points more likely to answer \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d. Finally, women are 7 percentage points less likely to correctly answer the awareness of crucial banking issues question. 23For comparison with the results reported in the study, we have estimated FK OVERALL using post-strati\ufb01cation weights that account for base weights and population proportions. Accordingly, the weighted FK OVERALL equals 0.495 (compared to 0.498 as reported in Table 4) and the level of \ufb01nancially literate individuals equals 36.3% (com- pared to the 37.33% as reported in Table 3). 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104\ufb01nancial literacy among young adults (see, for example, Lusardi et al., 2010; Andreou and Philip, 2018). This evidence is also corroborated by the correlation of this variable with FK OVERALL, which is -0.146 ( p-value<0.01). There is also a notable di\ufb00erence in \ufb01nancial knowledge between younger (25-29 years old) and older millennials (30-39 years old). The mean di\ufb00erences for younger millennials(YOUNGMILLENNIALS)andoldermillennials(OLDMILLENNIALS)standat-0.056 and -0.060 respectively. However, these are marginally signi\ufb01cant for YOUNG MILLENNIALS ( p- value<0.10) and insigni\ufb01cant for OLD MILLENNIALS (and the same result holds true for the p-values for Mann-Whitney tests). The number of respondents with a university degree (UNIVERSITY), the number of respon- dents studying Business at university (BUSINESS MAJOR) and the number of respondents em- ployed in the \ufb01nancial services industry (FINANCIAL) are statistically higher (p-values <0.01) in the \ufb01nancially literate sample, and the Mann-Whitney tests ( p-values<0.01) suggest that education andemploymentplayaveryimportantrolefor\ufb01nancialliteracy. Furthermore, allthecorresponding correlations of these variables with FK OVERALL are positive and highly statistically signi\ufb01cant.

However, changing primary bank (CHANGED BANK) in the last 12 months does not appear to be statistically signi\ufb01cant between the two samples. Regarding the characteristics and skills that matter for \ufb01nancial literacy scores the results show that the mean score of mathematical skills (MATHS SKILLS) and information technology skills (IT SKILLS) are statistically higher ( p-values<0.01) in the \ufb01nancially literate sample. The Kruskal-Wallis test also indicates that \ufb01nancial literacy is higher for those individuals with higher scores in MATHS SKILLS ( p-values<0.01) and IT SKILLS ( p-values<0.10). Both variables are also positively correlated with FK OVERALL ( p-values<0.01). Regarding the two \ufb01nancial be- haviour variables, i.e. risk-taking (RISK TAKING) and optimism (OPTIMISM), and the variable for cognition in avoiding numbers (AVOID NUMBERS), it appears that there is no statistically signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence between the high and low \ufb01nancial knowledge groups. An important question the paper aims to answer is not only whether respondents possess \ufb01nancial knowledge pro\ufb01ciency, but also whether their \ufb01nancial literacy level matters in \ufb01nancial decision-making and banking relationships. This is done by \ufb01rst examining whether the source 14 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104of information that individuals use when making \ufb01nancial decisions is related to their literacy levels. Table 4 shows that a higher proportion of respondents who rely on professional sources of information (ADVISE PROFESS) are in the high knowledge group, although the di\ufb00erences are not statistically signi\ufb01cant between the two samples. Yet, the correlation of this variable with FK OVERALL is 0.081 and statistically signi\ufb01cant ( p-value<0.05). Recent studies provide evidence ranging from a negative relationship between \ufb01nancial literacy and the demand for expert \ufb01nancial advice (see, for example, Hung and Yoong, 2010 for US), to a positive relationship (see, for example, Bhattacharya et al., 2012 for Germany), and also to no relationship at all (Georgarakos and Inderst, 2014). The results of our study, point to a weak univariate relationship between \ufb01nancial literacy and the propensity to seek advice from professionals in Cyprus. However, the mean score for trust in social media (TRUST SOCIAL MEDIA) is signi\ufb01cantly lower in the \ufb01nancial literacy group (mean di\ufb00erence = -0.468, p-value<0.10; correlation coe\ufb03cient = -0.106, p-value<0.01) and the Mann-Whitney has a p-value<0.10. This is a good indication that \ufb01nancially literate individuals are more likely to understand that they cannot trust social media information, recognising that it can be associated with fake news or scams. Of course, at the same time \ufb01nancially illiterate individuals may be more prone to falling prey to social media pressure and envy (see, also Andreou and Philip, 2018). 4.2 Determinants of \ufb01nancial literacy We investigate the determinants of \ufb01nancial literacy to see whether there are di\ufb00erential e\ufb00ects between the three sets of questions: FK BIG3 (Q1-Q3), FK BANK (Q4-Q6) and FK OVERALL (Q1-Q6). OLS results are presented in Table 5 using the three dependent variables, namely FK BIG3 in models (1) and (2), FK BANK in models (3) and (4) and FK OVERALL in models (5) and (6). A variance in\ufb02ation factor (VIF) test suggests no multicollinearity problems (mean VIF<1.500).24 As in prior studies, covariate demographics as well variables for personal traits and skills that may in\ufb02uence \ufb01nancial literacy levels are included. To gain more insights about the determinants of \ufb01nancial literacy, more socio-demographic covariates are considered in additional analyses. The speci\ufb01cation includes covariates pertaining to the respondents\u2019 banking activity. These include: a binary that equals one if the respondent currently has a customer relationship with three or more \ufb01nancial institutions (MULTIPLE BANKS), a binary that equals one if the respondent has a primary bank relationship for seven years or longer (LONG BANK), and a binary that equals one if the respondent has changed primary bank within the last year (CHANGED BANK). A binary is also included for indicating the respondent\u2019s skill set in using information technol- ogy (IT SKILLS) because these skills indicate an individuals\u2019 aptitude in using \ufb01nancial services via information technologies.",

Despite mixed evidence, \ufb01nancial literacy levels can be associated with some measures of \ufb01nancial 24The results remain qualitatively the same when using tobit regressions instead of OLS. 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104behaviour, for example the source of obtaining \ufb01nancial information. To take this into account, additional covariates were considered, particularly a binary indicating advice from professionals (ADVICE PROFESS) and a binary indicating the respondent\u2019 daily engagement with social net- works (HIGH SOCIAL MEDIA). Optimism is employed as one of the variables since it appears to play a role in risk-taking and portfolio choice. Optimistic consumers choose risky portfolios for their investments and have higher personal debt (see, for example, Puri and Robinson, 2007). Models (1), (2), (5) and (6) of Table 5 indicate that gender (GENDER) is positive and statisti- cally signi\ufb01cant ( p-values<0.01) for FK BIG3 and FK OVERALL; on average, female respondents score worse than male respondents on these questions, as already discussed. This signi\ufb01cant \ufb01nan- cialliteracy-genderbiasremainsstrongevenaftercontrollingforthelargersetofvariablesinmodels (2) and (6), evidence that also squares with the \ufb01ndings in Andreou and Philip (2018). However, the gender bias although still positive, does not appear as a statistically signi\ufb01cant determinant in models (3) and (4), where \ufb01nancial knowledge is measured as the average score of correct answers to the three banking related questions FK BANK (Q4-Q6). [Insert Table 5, here] Another robust \ufb01nding reported by prior studies across a number of countries is that \ufb01nancial literacy levels are lowest among the young and the old (see, for example, Lusardi et al., 2010; Lusardi and Tufano, 2015). Individuals aged 39 or younger, the so-called millennials or Generation Y,indeedshowlowerlevelsof\ufb01nancialliteracy. Lowliteracyamongtheyoungmightbeproblematic since this group faces \ufb01nancial decisions that in\ufb02uence their \ufb01nancial wellbeing for decades to come. Moreover, thisgeneration, nowmakingupthelargestshareofthelabourmarket, isvitalto\ufb01nancial institutions\u2019 success. Individuals aged 39 or younger, are increasingly swapping traditional banks fornewoptionsandretailbankingneedstoadjustitsbusinessmodels, productsandservicestokeep pace with the evolving views of this younger but maturing generation. In fact, results in models (5) and(6)indicatethatrespondentsaged25-29(YOUNGMILLENNIALS),aswellasthoseaged30-39 (OLDMILLENNIALS)scoredonaveragelowerthanolderrespondents( p-values<0.01); this\ufb01nding remains unchanged even after considering a larger set of explanatory variables ( p-values<0.01). It is striking that this well-documented result in the literature is apparent in models (3) and (4) but not in models (1) and (2) (only for YOUNG MILLENNIALS and without controlling for extra variables, the coe\ufb03cient is marginally signi\ufb01cant with a p-value<0.10). This further vindicates the inclusion of the three banking-related questions Q4-Q6 (in addition to the Big Three questions) in the construction of the \ufb01nancial knowledge measure. The results in models (2), (4) and (6) show that those who are employed in the \ufb01nancial services industry (FINANCIAL) tend to be more \ufb01nancially literate (p-value<0.01 for models (2) and (6) andp-value<0.05formodel(3)). Thiscanbeexplainedbythefactthatthoseworkinginthe\ufb01nance industryaremorelikelytobetterunderstandandbemoreawareofeconomicand\ufb01nancialconcepts, and hence have a higher level of \ufb01nancial literacy. Higher education (UNIVERSITY) also plays a signi\ufb01cant role ( p-value<0.01) in explaining \ufb01nancially knowledgeable individuals. The \ufb01nding is consistent with existing literature, which outlines that education is one of the most important 16 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104factors in ensuring adequate levels of understanding of \ufb01nancial concepts. These results, along with the high correlation with FK OVERALL shown in Table 4, help in the construction of valid instruments for \ufb01nancial literacy as discussed later. There is also some evidence in models (1), (3) and (5) to support that individuals who studied Business at university (BUSINESS MAJOR) are more likely to be \ufb01nancially literate than those who studied other subjects (although it turns insigni\ufb01cant when additional controls are included). This means that those with a high level of education and with a focus on business studies obviously have a higher level of \ufb01nancial literacy. The result suggests that courses related to \ufb01nance might have a signi\ufb01cant impact on \ufb01nancial literacy in university education (see, for example, Chen and Volpe, 1998; Xiao et al.,2007; and more recently Kaiser et al., 2020). Models (1) and (5), reporting positive coe\ufb03cients ( p-value<0.10 and p-value<0.05 respectively) of the high income variable (HIGH INCOME), lend some credence to the notion that individuals with high income are more \ufb01nancially knowledgeable than those with low income.",

In terms of evaluating the importance of respondents\u2019 soft skills and traits, the results show that individuals who consider themselves good in mathematics (MATHS SKILLS) have higher \ufb01nancial knowledge under all measures ( p-values<0.01 after controlling for many variables). Results do not support that there is a statistically signi\ufb01cant relationship between seeking \ufb01nancial advice from professionals (ADVICE PROFESS) and \ufb01nancial knowledge, something that squares with the univariate evidence in Table 4. The same holds true for the HIGH SOCIAL MEDIA variable. 5 The banking services channels: branch visit or i-banking use 5.1 Probit regressions The study investigates the factors that in\ufb02uence individuals\u2019 behaviour towards two types of bank- ing services, i.e. branch visits or i-banking, and whether \ufb01nancial literacy plays a role in each case. The question \u201c How often are you using the following banking services within a month: visit to the branch and i-banking? \u201d, as presented in Figure A1 of the Online Appendix, resulted in 33.83% of the respondents replying that they \u201crarely (or never)\u201d use i-banking. Figures A2a, A2b of the Online Appendix show a breakdown of the frequency of this response by age group and gender. The likelihood of visiting a branch \u201crarely (or never)\u201d is higher for young individuals while the reverse holds true for their likelihood of using i-banking \u201crarely (or never)\u201d. Given that the sample consists of people who have a bank account the next research question explores the determinants of this banking behaviour. Table 6A reports the probit regressions results to estimate respondents\u2019 behaviour for the two di\ufb00erent dependent variables: models (1) to (4) employ VISIT RARE that takes the value of one 17 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104when the respondent has answered \u201crarely (or never)\u201d for visiting a branch within a month and zero otherwise; models (5) to (8) employ ONLINE RARE that takes the value of one when the respondent has answered \u201crarely (or never)\u201d for using i-banking within a month and zero otherwise. The vector of explanatory variables includes socio-demographic covariates, i.e. gender (GEN- DER), age (MILLENNIALS), area of residence (METROPOLITAN and URBAN), banking ac- tivity (MULTIPLE BANKS, LONG BANK and CHANGED BANK) and two variables capturing behavioural characteristics, i.e. tendency to take risks (RISK TAKING) and optimism (OPTI- MISM). As our age variable, and for baseline probit regressions, we use MILLENNIALS rather than distinguishing between younger and older millennials, since the mean di\ufb00erences are only marginally signi\ufb01cant in Table 4, and the two variables appear to have the same e\ufb00ect on \ufb01nancial knowledge (both in terms of magnitude and signi\ufb01cance), as shown in Table 5. Other covariates in- cluded in the analysis are skills in using information technology (IT SKILLS), cognition in avoiding information involving numbers (AVOID NUMBERS) and two behavioural characteristics related to social media, i.e. daily social media engagement (HIGH SOCIAL MEDIA) and trust in social media (TRUST SOCIAL MEDIA). For completeness, Table A3 of the Online Appendix reports all pairwise correlations between dependent and independent variables. [Insert Table 6A, here] Model (1) shows the baseline probit model for VISIT RARE without any of our measures of \ufb01nancial literacy. Individuals who are younger are less likely to visit a branch while those that engage with multiple banks are more likely to often visit a branch within the last month. As shown in Table 6A, models (2) and (4) indicate that \ufb01nancial literacy (FK BIG3 and FK OVERALL) is signi\ufb01cantly negatively associated with branch visits for receiving on-the-spot banking services. Speci\ufb01cally, as both FK BIG3 and FK OVERALL increase, respondents declare that they visit more rarely a branch.",

Models (6) to (8) provide further evidence to support that \ufb01nancial literacy plays a pivotal role in the choice of channel for receiving banking services. As per these models, i-banking behaviour is largely driven by the \ufb01nancial literacy level (FK BIG3, FK BANK and FK OVERALL) of individuals, with strong statistical signi\ufb01cance ( p-value<0.01). Financially literate individuals have an increased probability of using i-banking and this result remains strong after including a large set of socio-demographic covariates, as well variables for skills, traits and behavioural characteristics. Speci\ufb01cally, in model (8), we evince that for one standard deviation increase in the respondents\u2019 mean \ufb01nancial knowledge score the average decrease in the probability of using i-banking \u201crarely (or never)\u201d is 7.5% ( p-value<0.01). This result suggests that people with high \ufb01nancial literacy 18 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104are more likely to frequently use i-banking, compared to those with low levels of \ufb01nancial literacy (holding other variables constant).25 Other factors that contribute to respondents\u2019 preference towards using i-banking as per models (5) to (8) are age, area of residence and soft skills.

More speci\ufb01cally, in model (8) the likelihood of \u201crarely (or never)\u201d using i-banking decreases on average by 19% for MILLENNIALS and by 7% for those living in an URBAN area. A one standard deviation increase in the mean score for skills in using information technology reduces by 14% on average the probability of \u201crarely (or never)\u201d using i-banking. A one standard deviation increase in the mean score for risk-taking behaviour (RISK TAKING), reduces by 4% on average the probability of \u201crarely (or never)\u201d using i-banking. High daily social media engagement (HIGH SOCIAL MEDIA) is not found to be a statistically signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uencing factor for i-banking use. Overall, these results suggest that increasing \ufb01nancial literacy among Cyptiots would increase the use of i-banking services. 5.2 Instrumental variable (IV) estimates Assessing the direction of causality between \ufb01nancial literacy and attitudes for receiving banking services (i.e. visiting a branch or using i-banking services) is a challenge, as \ufb01nancial literacy is potentially an endogenous variable. To address this problem, we rely on instrumental variable (IV) estimations using a set of two instruments, i.e. whether a respondent is employed in the \ufb01nancial services sector (FINANCIAL), and whether the respondent has a university degree (UNI- VERSITY), to exogenously measure exposure to \ufb01nancial information or to an environment with individuals having (higher) \ufb01nancial knowledge. Similar instruments have been employed in the literature. For instance, van Rooij et al. (2011, 2012) use the level of economics education as an instrument. Both these variables are positively (and signi\ufb01cantly) correlated with the main mea- sure of \ufb01nancial knowledge FK OVERALL in Table 4 and are signi\ufb01cant under all three \ufb01nancial knowledge measures in all speci\ufb01cations of Table 5. At the same time, we argue that these instruments are expected to be exogenous: employment in the \ufb01nancial sector and a university degree should have no direct e\ufb00ect on i-banking use. First, the indicator that we use in our regression measures employment in the \ufb01nancial services in a broad sense, i.e. the current classi\ufb01cation does not distinguish between di\ufb00erent jobs in the same sector. Second, basic skills alone such as those taught in universities should not have a direct e\ufb00ect on i-banking use. Therefore, we believe that a university degree only a\ufb00ects attitudes for receiving 25Conversely, we could de\ufb01ne the dependent variable as ONLINE FREQUENT by reversing the logical value in the variable ONLINE RARE; i.e.",

Wald statistics from the tests of exogeneity reject the null hypothesis ( p-values<0.01). Additional instrument validity tests are shown at the bottom of Table 6B. The Kleibergen-Paap LM and Wald statistics reject the null hypothesis that the equation is underidenti\ufb01ed or weakly identi\ufb01ed. Moreover, the Hansen Jtest of overidentifying restriction for both models shows that the instruments are valid. Together, these tests suggest that FINANCIAL and UNIVERSITY are valid instruments for \ufb01nancial literacy in our study. [Insert Table 6B, here] The results in model (2) show that the relationship between \ufb01nancial knowledge and \u201crarely (or never)\u201d visiting a branch remains positive and highly statistically signi\ufb01cant ( p-value<0.01), and the ones in model (4) show that the relationship between \ufb01nancial knowledge and using i-banking \u201crarely (or never)\u201d remains negative and highly statistically signi\ufb01cant ( p-value<0.01). As a further robustness check, we apply the IV method developed by Lewbel (2012) in addition to conventional IV methods. These IV results con\ufb01rm our earlier inferences that \ufb01nancial literacy has a positive and signi\ufb01cant impact on i-banking use (Table A4 in the Online Appendix). 5.3 Robustness and additional analyses First, to shed more light on the robustness of our \ufb01ndings, in the probit regressions of Table 6A we include more control variables that have been suggested in the literature. Given the evidence that there is a notable di\ufb00erence in \ufb01nancial knowledge between younger and older millennials (Yakoboski et al., 2018), we consider both younger millennials (YOUNG MILLENNIALS) and older millennials (OLD MILLENNIALS) as controls. Furthermore, income is observed to play an important role in explaining the level of \ufb01nancial knowledge in Cyprus (Andreou and Philip, 2018), so we also include individuals with higher income (HIGH INCOME). Table A5 of the Online Ap- pendix reports the results from this additional analysis and Table A3 reports pairwise correlations between the control variables. Overall, the inference of the positive e\ufb00ect of \ufb01nancial knowledge on the likelihood of frequently using i-banking remain statistically strong ( p-values<0.01) under the additional controls. Second, as a further robustness test, we replicated the probit regression results of Table 6A wherebyweuseasourexplanatoryvariablesthenumberof(i)\u201cWrong\u201dand(ii)\u201cDon\u2019tKnow/Don\u2019t Answer\u201d replies out of all responses to the six \ufb01nancial knowledge questions. The results presented in Table A6 of the Online Appendix broadly con\ufb01rm our \ufb01nding that high \ufb01nancial literacy levels (i.e. the lowest number of \u201cWrong\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Know/Don\u2019t Answer\u201d responses) are positively associated with the frequency of using i-banking. 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104Third, to gain more insight about the reasons for using i-banking \u201crarely (or never)\u201d, the survey participants are asked to provide on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means totally disagree and 10 means totally agree , to what extent they agree or disagree with four statements. Table 7, Panel A presents the summary statistics of the responses to those questions. The analysis of barriers to i-banking use shows that personal contact with a bank o\ufb03cer is the most prominent reason for 61.08% of the respondents that use i-banking \u201crarely (or never)\u201d. At the same time, 42.36% totally agree that lack of information technology skills is the reason for using i-banking \u201crarely (or never)\u201d, while 40.39% totally agree that lack of banking knowledge is the reason for using i-banking \u201crarely (or never)\u201d.

These two characteristics prevent many consumers in Cyprus from using i-banking services and make them more inclined to visit a branch to receive banking services. Digital \ufb01nancial illiteracy therefore appears as a factor that undermines Cypriot consumer appetite for i-banking. 6 Conclusions and policy implications The digital age and the advent of \ufb01nancial technologies have enabled access to a variety of \ufb01nancial products and services with only a click of a button. But little research to date has considered how the use of these new technologies is related to \ufb01nancial literacy. This study examines the level and antecedents of \ufb01nancial literacy and investigates its in\ufb02uence on i-banking behaviour. The results show that only 37.33% of the respondents have a good level of \ufb01nancial knowledge, with the problem appearing signi\ufb01cantly more severe among women and young individuals. Some of the interesting results of this study, include the gender gap, with males reporting higher levels of \ufb01nancial literacy than females, and an income and education channel a\ufb00ecting \ufb01nancial literacy. 21 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104Overall, the combined evidence shows that Cyprus ranks rather low in the global arena of \ufb01nancial literacy. Moreover, the results reveal a strong positive relationship between \ufb01nancial literacy and i- banking behaviour. While 33.83% of the respondents replied that they \u201crarely (or never)\u201d use i- banking, a higher \ufb01nancial knowledge score is positively associated with i-banking use for receiving on-the-spot banking services. Millennials tend to use i-banking more frequently and some skills are more important in explaining i-banking behaviour, namely skills in information technology. Policy guidance suggests that greater \ufb01nancial literacy and consumer con\ufb01dence may nurture more balanced behaviour with in regard to the management of wealth and budget in the long term (see, for example, OECD, 2015, 2016, 2018). This endeavour has now become even more imperative, as the OECD notes that \u201c in today\u2019s complex world, the development of an appropriate regulatory framework is essential, but not necessarily enough to guarantee the soundness of the \ufb01nancial system and the \ufb01nancial protection and wellbeing of individuals.... [hence] \ufb01nancial education should be developed hand-in-hand with an e\ufb03cient regulatory framework \u201d (2009, pp. 9). Therefore, increased levels of digital \ufb01nancial literacy could enable individuals to make well- informed and sound decisions, to prevent irresponsible behaviour and to better judge the risks and bene\ufb01ts associated with products and services o\ufb00ered through \ufb01nancial technologies. National strategies for \ufb01nancial education to improve digital \ufb01nancial literacy can equip and empowerindividualswiththerequired\ufb01nancialknowledgeandskillsaswellasdigitalpro\ufb01ciency, to cultivate con\ufb01dence in seeking appropriate \ufb01nancial advice, to avoid irrational behaviour and foster acumen to prudently evaluate economic conditions. In fact, digital \ufb01nancial literacy programmes notonlyeducateandtrainconsumerstoe\ufb00ectivelyutilisedigitalised\ufb01nancialproductsandservices, but can also empower them to better manage digital \ufb01nancial risks and avoid malicious digital activity(e.g. phishing, hackingattacksandunauthoriseduseofdata)(OECD,2017b). Accordingly, policy interventions towards enhancing individuals\u2019 \ufb01nancial literacy could play an important role in ensuring \ufb01nancial and economic stability and in mitigating the risk and impact of future \ufb01nancial crises by making households more resilient to shocks. Cyprus currently lacks a national strategy on \ufb01nancial literacy. Against this background, the \ufb01ndings from this study have some important implications for research and policy related to house- hold \ufb01nance. In the speci\ufb01c Cypriot context, the overall \ufb01ndings of this study in conjunction with the results of Andreou and Philips (2018), who show that students enter university without possess- ing essential \ufb01nancial knowledge and skillsets indicate that perhaps including a \u201cPersonal Finance\u201d course in secondary and tertiary curricula could enable students to learn important \ufb01nancial con- cepts that would then help them make sound \ufb01nancial decisions later on life.",

The \ufb01nancial industry could also be actively involved in programmes focusing on \ufb01nancial education. For example, organisa- tions could o\ufb00er free online training courses for teachers, design interactive activities and organise competitions for students to test their \ufb01nancial knowledge, sending newsletters to schools, etc. However, in order to identify key areas and shape appropriate policy suggestions the develop- 22 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104ment of a wave of survey (e.g. every three years), in collaboration with a team of experts should be commenced. This would allow the regular monitoring of \ufb01nancial behaviour and evaluation of the e\ufb00ectiveness of \ufb01nancial education initiatives, something that could not be considered in this study. Moreover, with a view to improving consumer protection in the \ufb01nancial market, the government could also evaluate the impact and suitability of the various programmes launched over the years across countries so that best practices can be replicated in Cyprus (for an overview, see EBA, 2020). These include a call centre helpline that could o\ufb00er free counselling to assist consumers in ensuring sound decision-making and preventing over-indebtedness or a website to gather and dis- seminate currently dispersed information using simple and educational language, as well to create a community for exchanging experiences. Interactive applications have also proven to be very useful in promoting \ufb01nancial education in other countries. 23 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3499104References [1] Agnew, J.R. & Szykman, L.R.

        "content": "Efficacy of a Mean Reversion Trading Strategy Using True Strength Index (TSI) Abstract: This paper presents a detailed examination of a mean reversion trading strategy centered around the True Strength Index (TSI), applied to the SPY (S&P 500) and QQQ (Nasdaq Index). The strategy's robustness is thoroughly evaluated through an extensive analy sis covering historical data from 1996 to 2022. This includes a critical assessment during out -of-sample periods and paper trading to ensure a comprehensive understanding of its performance across different market conditions. Key performance metrics scruti nized include Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), Maximum Drawdown (Max DD), Sharpe Ratio, and Sortino Ratio. These metrics provide insight into the strategy's profitability, its risk management efficiency, and overall effectiveness. The study aims to cont ribute to the existing body of knowledge in financial market trading strategies, offering a nuanced perspective on the applicability and sustainability of mean reversion strategies in the dynamic landscape of equity markets. Introduction: The study introduces a mean reversion strategy, focusing on the TSI as the main indicator. This strategy aims to capitalize on short price movements (average 5 days) reverting to a mean value. The paper outlines the strategy's premise and its application in diverse market conditions . This strategy is implemented on the QQQ ETF and SPY ETF. \u2022 QQQ : Invesco QQQ Trust, is an exchange -traded fund that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq -100 Index. \u2022 SPY: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, is an exchange -traded fund that seeks to track the performance of the S&P 500 Index. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4708400 Methodology The trading system implemented in this research generates open and close signals, with the execution of trades occurring at the market close. Positions are subsequently initiated or liquidated at the opening market price of the following trading day. Data Partitioning : For the assurance of the trading system's robustness and dependability, we divided the historical ETF data spanning from January 1996 to December 2022 into two datasets: in -sample and out -of-sample. \u2022 The in -sample dataset, which is pivotal for the development of the model, comprises the years 2000 to 2018. \u2022 The out -of-sample dataset, serving for an unbiased evaluation of the model, is segregated into two periods: 1996 to 1999 and 2019 to 2022. \u2022 The strategy's efficacy has been preliminarily tested through paper trading commencing in January 2023. Strategy Outline and Auxiliary Indicators: Central to our strategy is the True Strength Index (TSI), a momentum oscillator adept at identifying mean reversion opportunities. The TSI's role is crucial in detecting conditions where the market is considered overbought or oversold, signaling potential price corrections. For the purposes of this study, we focus on long positions during oversold conditions as indicated by the TSI. In support of the TSI, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is employed as a secondary filter. The RSI aids in affirming the trading signals generated by the TSI by identifying points where price movements may be reaching an extremity, indicative of potential trend reversals. The concurrent use of TSI and RSI seeks to refine the accuracy of trade signals and reduce the incidence of false triggers. Additional indicators are integrated to provide secondary decision support, evaluating market volatility and assisting in the determination of strategic exit points. This is critical to the strategy's risk management, ensuring alignment with the prevailing market dynamics. Furthermore, the strategy leverages additional technical indicators, such as moving averages for trend analysis and bespoke oscillators for specific market conditions, to further refine the generated signals. This combination provides a multi -faceted frame work designed to capture mean reversion opportunities while managing risk effectively. It is noteworthy that while the strategy is specifically tailored to trading the SPY (S&P 500 ETF) and QQQ (Nasdaq -100 Index ETF), it possesses the flexibility to be adapted for trading the associated futures.

This discussion aims to delve into the nuances o f the strategy\u2019s performance, its strengths and limitations, and the broader implications of our findings. Performance in Different Market Conditions The backtesting results from 1996 to 2023, encompassing both in -sample and out -of-sample periods, indicate that the Mean Reversion strategy, when applied using TSI, exhibits a noteworthy capacity to capitalize on short -term price movements. Notably, the s trategy demonstrated resilience during various market phases, including turbulent periods, which suggests a level of robustness in the face of market volatility. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that past perf ormance is not always indicative of future results, especially in the ever -evolving landscape of financial markets. Strengths of the Strategy One of the primary strengths of this strategy lies in its systematic approach to identifying potential trading opportunities based on well -established technical indicators. The TSI's effectiveness in pinpointing overbought and oversold market conditions, complemented by the RSI for additional signal confirmation, presents a methodical way to engage in mean reversion trading. Moreover, the incorporation of other technical indicators, such as moving averages, adds layers of validatio n, enhancing the strategy\u2019s overall reliability. Limitations and Risks Despite its promising results, the strategy is not without its limitations. The reliance on historical data and technical indicators may not fully account for sudden, unforeseen market events or shifts in fundamental market dynamics. Additionally, the strategy's performance could be sensitive to the specific parameters set for the TSI and RSI . Implications for Investors and Traders For investors and traders, the findings of this study underscore the importance of diversification and risk management. While the Mean Reversion strategy could be a valuable addition to a trader\u2019s arsenal, it should be employed as part of a diversified po rtfolio strategy. Additionally, traders should remain vigilant about market changes that might affect the strategy's performance. Reflection on Methodology The methodology employed in this study, involving rigorous backtesting and analysis across different time periods, provides a comprehensive view of the strategy\u2019s performance. However, the effectiveness of any backtesting is inherently limited by the qual ity and extent of the historical data available. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4708400 Conclusion In summarizing the insights garnered from our extensive study of the Mean Reversion strategy using the True Strength Index (TSI) applied to SPY and QQQ ETFs, it becomes evident that this strategy has considerable potential in the realm of financial trading .",

If the retail trading experience got a bit worse, there might be a bit less retail trading, and deep down that might be what the SEC wants.\u201d (Matt Levine, Bloomberg, June 7, 2022) 1. Introduction Trading commission fees for retail stock trades have never been lower. Over the past decade, retail trading platforms worldwide have progressively adopted a new business model featuringzerocommissionfeesonvariousinvestmentactions, includingcommonstocktrades. This business model is perceived by some as transforming the financial market landscape, enabling a more extensive range of individuals to participate in stock markets, and with greater intensities, without being encumbered by prohibitive costs. In parallel, retail investor trading activity has surged in recent years. In response, regu- latory scrutiny has intensified, with a particular focus on the fact that retail investors now comprise approximately 20% of all trading volume in U.S. stock and options markets (e.g., Bryzgalova et al. (2022); de Silva et al. (2022)). In line with the opening quote, an ongoing regulatory debate revolves around the implications of retail growth for the efficiency of price discovery, retail investors\u2019 welfare, and whether to impose speed bumps to curb the perceived excess in retail trading activity (e.g., Ernst and Spatt (2022)). However,itisunclearhowandtowhatextentthereductionsincommissionfeesinfluenced retail investors\u2019 behavior. This is because the industry\u2019s shift toward zero commission fees coincided with a variety of correlated factors such as the proliferation of handheld devices, the rising popularity of online trade forums (e.g., WallStreetBets), the growth of trading apps (e.g., Robinhood), and stay-at-home orders during the COVID pandemic. Our study is motivated by the following questions: First, how sensitive are investors\u2019 trading activity and portfolio holdings to changes in commission fees? Second, how do com- mission fees influence the composition of retail investors participating in the stock market? Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42260442 Finally, how do changes in fees affect the net investment returns of the modern generation of retail investors? This question incorporates not only the direct impact of the fees themselves, but also the indirect effect where fees first shape the trading decisions of retail investors. As an overview, we provide novel evidence that trading commission fees indeed have wide ranging causal effects on various aspects of retail investor behavior encompassing trading activity, diversification, portfolio composition, and the demography of retail investors. The absence of prior evidence on the link between commission fees and retail investor outcomes likely stems from the inherent challenges in establishing causality in most research settings due to the potential for confounding trends. Our study aims to fill this gap. To isolate the specific influence of commission fees, we use a novel triple-difference research design around the staggered removal of fees for retail investors on eToro, an international multi-asset online retail brokerage platform.",

        "content": "Our main sample consists of user-level transaction data spanning a 13-month window from 2018-2019 surrounding the staggered removal of fees on eToro. During a 4-week period spanning April to May of 2019, eToro removed fees for trading equities in select countries. Moreover, the fee removal only applied to non-leveraged equity trades (i.e., standard equity trades)butnottoleveragedlongorshortsaleequitytrades. Thecombinationofthesefactors allowsustoconductarobusttriple-differenceresearchdesigntoassessthespecificroleplayed by trading fees. The first differencing involves comparing individual users\u2019 trading behavior before and after the fee removal. The second differencing entails comparing users in countries where fees were removed with those in countries where fees remained unchanged during our sample window. The final differencing compares changes in users\u2019 behavior concerning non- leveraged trades, which were subject to the fee removal, against leveraged and short sale trades, for which fees were unchanged. Combined with user- and month-level fixed effects, our triple-difference research design allows us to mitigate numerous potential confounds that could otherwise hinder our ability Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42260443 to establish a causal relationship between the changes in fees and retail investors\u2019 trading behavior. For example, alternative explanations based on media campaigns or changes in the platform that occurred concurrently with the fee removal would struggle to explain differences in trading for affected versus unaffected investments as well as in affected versus unaffected countries. In the pre-period, eToro structured its fees using a fixed percentage of 80 basis points (bps) per dollar invested, which amounted to over 10% in fees per year for the average eToro customer in our sample. Fees were displayed in dollar terms directly beneath the buttons to confirm a given order, suggesting that investors were likely accustomed to viewing fees beforeplacinganorder. Followingthefeeremoval, userswerepresentedwithhighlightedtext indicating that their order was \u201cCommission Free\u201d before placing the order. Consequently, we expect that fee removal likely had a substantial impact on customers\u2019 perceptions of the payoffs from investing. We begin our analysis by estimating the sensitivity of retail investors\u2019 trading demand to changes in fees. Economically, retail investors increased average monthly portfolio turnover and trade frequency by over 30 percent. This increase occurs immediately following the fee removal but not before. Moreover, the uptick in trading is driven by users in countries where fees were removed (\u201ctreated countries\u201d) and exclusively for non-leveraged equity trades, while we observe no effect among users in non-treated countries, among leveraged trades, or among short equity trades. Further, placebo tests and examination of the parallel trends assumption cast significant doubt on reverse causality concerns. For example, the precise timing and concentration of changesinretailbehaviormitigatesconcernthatourresultsreflecteToroselectivelyremoving fees in anticipation of forecasted spikes in retail demand. Collectively, these results suggest that the increase in trading activity is directly attributable to the fee removal, rather than secular trends in retail trader participation or improvements to the eToro platform. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42260444 Investors\u2019 portfolio turnover increased following fee removal despite an approximate 7% decrease in average trade size. This decrease is economically modest relative to the uptick in trade frequency but may be somewhat surprising since eToro did not charge a fixed fee for each trade, which would naturally penalize a larger quantity of small trades. Instead, eToro structured its fees in the pre-period using a fixed percentage irrespective of the number of times that a user traded. We consider a series of potential explanations for the decrease in trade size, including those that assume full- and partial-optimality on behalf of eToro customers. Our findings align most closely with users being responsive to the removal of fees, but not fully compre- hending their structure in the pre-period. For example, using demographic information, we show that the reduction in trade size is concentrated among inexperienced investors with smaller account sizes and lower technological sophistication, who we expect are more likely to confuse fixed and variable rates (e.g., Feldman et al. (2016)). In contrast, we find limited evidence that reduced trade sizes were driven by fully rational motives such as concerns over worse execution quality (i.e., higher price impact) for large trades following fee removal. One probable contributing factor for why eToro customers might have plausibly misunderstood commission fees is that many competitor retail platforms charged a fixed fee per trade, un- like eToro\u2019s per dollar fee structure (Kothari et al. (2021)).",

        "content": "Additionally, eToro displayed their fees in dollar terms before trade submission rather than as a percentage of the amounts traded, making it more difficult to understand how fees were structured. A key set of findings in our study is that fee removal also prompted changes in the com- position of eToro customers\u2019 portfolios across multiple dimensions. First, eToro customers decreased their leverage-risk by increasing the proportion of their portfolio held in non- levered positions relative to leveraged or short positions, consistent with customers shifting their portfolios toward lower fee assets and strategies. Second, investors responded to fee removal by holding more diversified portfolios containing a greater number of unique stocks and industries, which in turn reduced the average return correlation among the positions in Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42260445 their portfolio. Due in part to low pre-period diversification, fee removal spurred meaningful changes in diversification. For example, industry diversification increased by approximately 14% following the fee removal. These results are most consistent with capital-constrained investors trading smaller amounts across a broader range of securities in response to the perception that fee removal disproportionately decreased costs of trading smaller positions. Whileourtriple-differenceresearchdesignfocusesontheintensivemarginofinvestors, we also document changes in the extensive margin of eToro investors following the fee removal. We find that the removal led to a significant surge in new eToro customers, consistent with the fee removal being employed to attract and retain investors. A striking result is that we observe a sharp increase among young investors, suggesting that fee removal induces individuals to invest in the stock market at a younger age. We also see an uptick in users who report no prior experience investing, users with smaller amounts of money, and users with lesser technological sophistication. Thus, our findings suggest that trading commission fees affect the composition and average sophistication of market participants by altering the extensive margin of retail investors. Ourfinaltestsexaminetheimplicationsofthefeeremovaloninvestorperformance. These tests are motivated by the seminal findings in Barber and Odean (2000), which demonstrate that excessive trading is detrimental to retail investor wealth. Barber and Odean (2000) showthatretailinvestors\u2019grossinvestmentreturnsfailedtooutperformmarketindexreturns despiteretailinvestorsassuminggreaterrisk, andthatinvestorssignificantlyunderperformed on a net basis after accounting for transaction costs. Our tests and use of more recent data are particularly important in light of more recent evidence of modern retail investors being distinct from earlier generations of investors and more prone to excessive, attention-based trading(e.g.,Barberetal.(2022a)). Ourstudyextendsthesefindingsbyexamininginvestors\u2019 gross performance and performance net of fees after accounting for how the fees first impact investor behavior (i.e., what to trade and how often to trade them). Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42260446 We study the relationship between fee removal and investor performance in two stages: first, we examine users\u2019 gross performance without accounting for commission fees, and sec- ond, we examine net performance after accounting for commission fees. Employing portfolio- level tests following Seasholes and Wu (2007) and user-level tests based on portfolio holdings, we find no significant difference in the ability of users\u2019 trades to predict returns or users\u2019 gross performance following fee removal, in terms of both raw returns and alphas. By using fee removal as a shock to retail trading intensity, an important implication of our findings is that trading more frequently does not inherently make retail investors worse off on average in terms of investment returns. Upon examining net performance after accounting for commission fees in the pre-period, we find that users in treated countries actually fare better after the removal of fees. Econom- ically, users\u2019 performance improves by around 11% on an annualized basis, which is almost entirely driven by investment losses due to fees in the pre-period. These findings suggest that fee removal benefited eToro users in terms of their net returns, especially considering our evidence that these users likely reduced their risk exposure through lower leverage and increased diversification. The central contribution of our paper is three-fold. First, we show that retail investors earn higher returns on a net basis after accounting for fees incurred in the pre-period. This improvement in net performance is consistent with arguments that the combination of zero commission fees and payment for order flow (PFOF) benefits retail investors by reducing total trading costs.",

        "content": "These findings also mitigate concerns that fee removal led to the gami- fication of investing and harmed retail investors by encouraging more ill-advised, gambling- or attention-based trading. In line with our findings of improved net returns, we find no evidence that fee removal prompted investors to trade smaller stocks, lottery-like stocks, or glamour stocks. Thus, our paper provides cleanly identified evidence against concerns that the modern generation of retail investors lose money due to poor stock-picking ability and/or attention-based herding (e.g., Odean (1999), Barber et al. (2022a)). Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42260447 Second, our novel research design allows us to narrow in on the specific role of trading commissions as a speed bump for retail activity in financial markets. Consequently, our find- ings speak to the ongoing regulatory debates regarding retail investors and retail brokerages. As of this writing, the SEC is considering rules that would combat the PFOF revenue model that underpins most retail platforms (Ernst and Spatt (2022)). If revenue from PFOF is no longer available, retail brokers will likely need to revert to charging commission trading fees to sustain operations. Our evidence suggests that such a move would discourage retail participation and diversification in financial markets. Finally, our results also suggest that commission-free trading affects the extensive margin by attracting less experienced investors with smaller amounts of capital. The increased participation of individual investors likely influences market liquidity and the economy\u2019s risk-bearing capacity, which in turn could potentially impact firms\u2019 costs of capital. Several caveats are merited. First, while we find that eToro users\u2019 trades are highly correlated with NASDAQ retail order flow, eToro differs from other popular retail brokerage platforms in several ways, including the fact that eToro users are geographically disperse across several countries with different market infrastructures and regulations. Additionally, our tests are, by design, limited to a specific time period before the onset of the pandemic. Therefore, it is unclear whether our findings are generalizable to other brokerages or during periods of market turmoil, and they do not speak to potential long-term consequences of removing trading fees. Second, our analyses focus on participation rates, diversification, and return performance, but do not account for other factors related to investor utility such as the amount of free-time consumed while investing (e.g., D\u2019Acunto et al. (2019)). Finally, our findings do not speak to the impact of retail investors on market outcomes such as volatility and price discovery, which are likely of first-order importance to regulators.

Data, Sample Construction, and Descriptive Statistics The data for our study includes information on trades and daily positions from January 2015 to December 2019 for over 160,000 investors who use eToro for equity trading. To make the sample tractable, eToro furnished us with account-level data for all customer accounts that funded their accounts and executed at least one trade using their copy trader service since account inception.1We restrict our sample to users who trade equities and reside in the six regions where eToro provided information regarding fee removal event dates \u2014 UK, Europe, Australia, Asia, Arab, and South and Central America. Users in these regions account for approximately 89% of the over 160,000 unique equity investors in the eToro dataset. As discussed later in this section, we confirm that our eToro data is consistent with measures of total retail volume from other data providers, indicating that our inferences are not likely confined to our sample. Panel A of Appendix A outlines the dates when eToro removed trading fees for non- leveraged equity transactions, sorted by region and country. When analyzing the effects of fee removal on trade behavior and portfolio performance, we exclude the one month period from April 11 to May 10, 2019. This is due to eToro\u2019s staggered approach to fee removal during this period, where different countries experienced fee removal on different dates.2We construct a time-balanced sample and limit it to six months before (the \u201cpre- period\u201d)andsixmonthsafter(the\u201cpost-period\u201d)thefeeremovaleventmonthfortworeasons.

        "content": "To alleviate concerns about generalizability, we also show in Table A1 of the Online Appendix that active and less active users of the copy trader service exhibit similar portfolio turnover levels and look economically similar in key user demographics, such as investment experience and sophistication. 2In Table A2 of the Online Appendix, we run our main triple-difference analyses separately for Group 1 countries (where eToro removed fees on April 15, 2019) and Group 2 countries (where eToro removed fees on May 6, 2019), using the same non-treated countries as a control for each group. Our results are largely consistent across both groups. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42260449 a significant increase in retail trading behavior for reasons likely unrelated to fee removal (de Silva et al. (2022)). Second, countries in our control group also experienced fee removal in 2020, which would disqualify them as control samples. Consequently, our sample period begins on October 9, 2018, and concludes on November 6, 2019. A limitation of this design, which focuses on a relatively short time period around the fee removal, is that it prevents us from examining the longer-term implications of fee removal.3 Users trading any asset class on the eToro platform have the ability to execute non- leveraged, leveraged, or short-sale trades. Since fee removal only pertains to non-leveraged equity positions, we utilize leveraged and short equity trades as a control group. This approach allows us to study variations in trading behavior for the same individual at the same point in time.4To construct our sample for each type of equity trade, we stipulate that users must have held a position in the corresponding trade type during the pre-period. Panel B of Appendix A provides information on the sub-samples for each trade type. The non-leveraged trade type sample consists of 14,602 users, with 65.9% residing in treated countries; the leveraged trade type sample consists of 38,935 users, with 74.5% residing in treated countries; and the short trade type sample consists of 16,501 users, with 73.8% residing in treated countries. Upon signing up for an eToro account, users are required to complete a Know Your Cus- tomer (KYC) survey. This collects self-reported demographic information, such as gender, income, and age, in addition to information about each user\u2019s level of investing expertise. Starting with the descriptive statistics in Table 1, we leverage demographic data to charac- terize eToro customers and examine how the effects of fee removal vary across different users. We focus specifically on user Age,I(No Experience) , an indicator equal to one if the user 3As reported in Appendix A, eToro first removed fees in Europe and the UK before extending this change to other countries, commencing with its largest customer markets in Europe and the UK and intentionally rolling out fee removal gradually. 4Leveraged and short equity trades are conducted via CFDs, which effectively serve as contracts delivering return swaps on the underlying asset. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604410 reported no previous trading experience upon account creation, and I(Income <= $50,000) , an indicator equal to one if the user reports an annual income of $50,000 or less.5Addi- tionally, we measure a user\u2019s level of technological sophistication based on their reported occupation. We set I(Low Technological Sophistication) equal to one for users who report an occupation in a non-STEM and non-finance related industry. All variables are defined in Appendix B. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for users across our three trade type samples: non-leveraged (Panel A), leveraged (Panel B) and short (Panel C). Additionally, for our difference-in-difference-in-difference (triple difference) design, we focus on users who hold both non-leveraged and leveraged (short) positions in the pre-period. We then compute each outcome variable as the difference between the non-leveraged and leveraged (or short) outcome variable. Panels D and E present descriptive statistics for the non-leveraged minus leveraged and non-leveraged minus short samples, respectively. We provide these descriptive statistics on our trade behavior and portfolio performance variables for the pre-fee removal period (October 9, 2018, to April 10, 2019) to aid in the interpretation of the economic magnitude of the effects of fee removal effects discussed in Section 3.",

Since the same eToro user can trade non-leveraged, leveraged, and short trades, our user characteristics remain consistent across the different panels. Specifically, our typical eToro user is about 37 years old. Approximately half of all users have no previous trading experience when they register for an account, and around 65% report an annual income of less than $50K. 5One limitation of the eToro KYC data is that users select their income range from a set of options rather than reporting their exact annual income. Given that eToro altered these options multiple times throughout our sample period, it\u2019s not possible to estimate user income consistently. However, we can consistentely identify users with an annual income below $50,000, and use this cut-off to discern variations in income. Our findings remain similar when we scale users\u2019 income by their home country\u2019s GDP. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604411 A potential concern regarding any study of a specific sub-population is the generaliz- ability of the results to other groups. Considering the size of the US market and potential heterogenity among customers across platforms, it is natural to question whether our find- ings can inform us about the causal effect of zero fees on US retail investors. While a direct answer would require account-level data from US discount brokers who underwent a similar change, which we cannot access, an indirect response can be obtained by comparing the trading behavior of eToro investors to that of US retail investors. In short, we find a strong correlation between these two groups both in terms of time series and cross section. To address this, we obtain the \u201cRetail Trading Activity Tracker\u201d from NASDAQ, which covers roughly 45% of US retail order flow. The data provides day-stock measures of \u201cactiv- ity\u201d, the ratio of dollars traded by retail investors in a given ticker divided by total dollars traded by retail investors across all tickers, and \u201csentiment\u201d, measuring the retail net flows (buy minus sell) over the most recent ten trading days. We aggregate the individual trading behavior of eToro investors to produce corresponding stock-day measures. Following this, we run panel regressions with either date, firm, or date and firm fixed effects for each of these measures with double-clustered standard errors. The results, reported in Appendix C, are consistent and robust. The relationship between US retail investors and eToro investors, as measured by these non-directional and directional measures, is highly significant, with R2s for activity being 65%and for sentiment being 10%. Indeed, the relationship is sufficiently strong to be discerned visually. In Appendix D, we see similar evidence of external valid- ity when plotting the NASDAQ activity level (in blue) relative to eToro (in red) for three prominent stocks among retail investors: AAPL, NTFX, and TSLA. 3. Identification Our main tests gauge whether and to what extent the removal of trading fees affects retail investor behavior and performance. We leverage eToro\u2019s decision to remove trading Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604412 fees only on non-leveraged equity trades and only for users residing in specific countries. This allows us to employ both a difference-in-difference and triple difference research design. We compare the following three differences, while controlling for user-level effects: user behavior before versus after fee removal, users residing in countries where fees were removal versus those in countries where fees were not removed, and non-leveraged equity transactions versus leveraged equity trades and short sale equity trades. Our main tests consist of panel regressions of the following form: Outcome i,m=\u03b11\u00b7Post m\u00d7Treat i+\u03b3i+\u03c8m+\u03f5i,m, (1) where the iandmsubscripts index the user and month, respectively. Outcome i,mdenotes various measures of retail investor behavior, including trading intensity, diversification, hold- ings, and performance. The use of user-level data allows for a high-level of control. We include individual fixed-effects ( \u03b3i), thereby controlling for individual-level heterogeneity. Additionally, the ability to track the same individuals both before and after the fee removal helps control for composition effects. We also include month fixed-effects ( \u03c8m) to absorb market-wide changes.",

We do not cluster solely by region due to the small number of clusters. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604413 fixed effects, respectively, due to perfect multicollinearity. Our first research design restricts the sample to non-leveraged transactions. Within this subsample, we compare the effect of the fee removal on users\u2019 non-leveraged equity trading behavior in treated countries with that in non-treated countries. This design utilizes users in non-treated countries as a control. A potential concern is that our results might be driven by confounding events unique to either treated or non-treated countries but not both. To address this concern, our main tests also limit our sample to leveraged trades and short-sale trades and repeat our analysis. In these two subsamples, we do not expect to find an effect on users in treated countries relative to those in non-treated countries because eToro did not remove fees for either leveraged or short trades. Therefore, if there is a confounding effect, our results should still be observable for these two subsamples. Furthermore, to alleviate concerns that the type of users who trade non-leveraged trades might differ from those who trade leveraged- or short-trades, we restrict our sample to users who trade either both non-leveraged and leveraged trades or both non-leveraged and short- trades. We simultaneously employ all three levels of differences to ensure that our results are attributable to the fee removal (Gruber (2006), Rauh (1994), Butler and Cornaggia (2011), Kim (2018)). Specifically, in this analysis we compare the difference in retail investors\u2019 trading behavior between non-leveraged and leveraged equity trades for investors in treated countries with the differences in retail investors\u2019 trading behavior between non-leveraged and leveraged equity trades for investors in non-treated countries. We then repeat this analysis using short-sale equity trades instead of leveraged equity trades. If the fee removal affects investors\u2019 trading behavior, we should observe a stronger effect on non-leveraged equity trades of retail investors in treated countries compared to other trades. Finally, it is important to note that while our analysis is designed to estimate the average treatment effect, we conduct it at the user level. Thus, any changes in the composition of investors in the post-fee-removal period cannot account for our results. This also enables Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604414 more precise identification since individual investors\u2019 behavior exhibits a large degree of heterogeneity (e.g., Giglio et al. (2021)). To account for this, we consistently include user fixed-effects throughout our analysis. Despite our robust research design, we cannot entirely dismiss the potential existence of a confounding effect that might solely impact users in treated countries and only non- leveraged trades, excluding users in non-treated countries and leveraged- or short trades, around the fee removal event. Although the likelihood of observing such a confounding effect is remarkably low, we provide time series plots to illustrate that our observed effects are predominantly concentrated at the time of the fee removal (Panel A of Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4). Combining these results with placebo tests discussed more below, these results further support our assertion that it is the fee removal, rather than another event, that is driving our results. Overall, our identification strategy proficiently establishes the causal effects of the regulation while minimizing the possibility of confounding factors driving our results. 4. Results 4.1.

        "content": "In Panel A of Table 2, we measure eToro customers\u2019 portfolio turnover, denotedMonthly Turnover , as the total buy and sell volume in a given month, scaled by the average monthly amount invested in the user\u2019s portfolio. In column (1), we first limit the sample to non-leveraged equity transactions and compare changes in the portfolio turnover of users in treated countries to those in non-treated countries. Asshownincolumn(1), thecoefficientfor Post\u00d7Treatissignificantlypositive, indicating the monthly turnover of non-leveraged trades increased following fee removal in treated countries. In economic terms, the portfolio turnover of non-leveraged trades increased by Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604415 0.126 per month relative to a baseline of 0.389, reflecting a 32% increase. A potential concern with the results in column (1) is that our control group of retail investors in non-treated countries might be affected by unrelated changes. For example, changes in market conditions could differently impact investors in treated and non-treated countries. To mitigate this concern, we re-run Eq. (1) for the sample of leveraged equity trades and short sale trades in columns (2) and (3), respectively. For these two types of trades, we do not anticipate any differential impact on treated users since the fee removal only applied to non-leveraged equity transactions. As expected, we observe no significant changes in portfolio turnover for leveraged and short trades in these two columns. This mitigates concerns that our column (1) results might be driven by a secular increase in retail investor trading unrelated to fee removal. Finally, in columns (4) and (5) of Panel A, we intentionally limit our sample to users who, in the pre-period, held both non-leveraged and either leveraged or short positions, respectively. This allows us to employ a triple-difference regression, comparing changes in the portfolio turnover of non-leveraged trades relative to either leveraged trade turnover or short trade turnover for users in treated countries versus those in non-treated countries. We continue to find our coefficient of interest is significantly positive in each of these columns. In column (4), when focusing on the difference between non-leveraged and leveraged trades, the estimated effect is a 36% increase in turnover, which aligns closly with the economic magnitude implied in our column (1) specification. To better understand the factors contributing to the rise of users\u2019 monthly portfolio turnover, we decompose turnover into its two components: number of trades and average trade size (as a proportion of total portfolio value). In Panel B of Table 2, we again estimate Eq. (1) for Monthly Number of Trades , which is defined as the total number of trades a user executes in a given month. Panel B of Table 2 shows that users\u2019 average number of trades mirrors the trend observed in portfolio turnover. Specifically, in column (1), we find that the Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604416 monthly number of non-leveraged trades increased by 1.502 per month relative to a baseline of 4.144, reflecting a 36% increase. Echoing our findings in Panel A, we do not observe a similar effect for leveraged and short trades (columns (2) and (3) of Panel B, respectively). Finally, columns (4) and (5) reinforce our results from column (1) using our triple-difference design. Panel C of Table 2 reports the results of studying changes in Monthly Average Trade Size, defined as the monthly average trade size scaled by total portfolio value. As shown in column (1), we find a statistically significant, yet economically modest, decrease in the monthly average trade size of non-leveraged trades for users in treated countries relative to those in non-treated countries. Specifically, we find a reduction of \u22120.021 relative to a baseline of 0.292, representing a 7% reduction (compared to an over 30% increase in portfolio turnover and number of trades shown in Panels A and B). In column (2) of Panel C, we also find some evidence that users from treated countries, in the leveraged sample, reduce their average trade size in the post-period compared to users in non-treated countries.",

        "content": "However, in column (4), when we focus on users who execute both non-leveraged and leveraged trades, the significantly negative coefficient implies that the reduction in trade size for non-leveraged trades is greater than the reduction in trade size for leveraged trades for these users. Column (5) yields a similar conclusion among users who conduct both non-leveraged and short trades. The reduction in average trade size shown in Panel C of Table 2 might initially seem surprising because eToro did not charge a fixed fee per trade, which would inherently dis- courage numerous small trades. Instead, during the pre-perod, eToro\u2019s fee structure was a fixed percentage \u2013 80 bps per dollar invested \u2013 irrespective of the number of times that a user traded. We consider a variety of potential explanations for this decrease in trade size, considering both those that assume full rationality and those that assume partial-rationality on the part of eToro\u2019s customers. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604417 For example, the reduction in trade size could be driven by users believing that the fee removal disproportionately decreased the cost of smaller trades. A likely contributing factor is the fee structure of many competing retail platforms, which charged a fixed fee per trade, as opposed to eToro\u2019s fee-per-dollar structure (Kothari et al. (2021)). Moreover, eToro consolidateditsfeesintoasinglelineitemonmonthlystatementsandonlyreportedthedollar value of fees charged, complicating the task of determining whether trading fees constituted a fixed cost, variable cost, or a combination of both. Our hypothesis, which suggests investors might have misunderstood the fee structure, is consistent with prior literature finding that taxpayers often misinterpret variable and fixed rates (Feldman et al. (2016)). To explore this hypothesis, we utilize subsamples of users, classified by characteristics that signal a higher or lower degree of sophistication. Utilizing eToro\u2019s user demographic (KYC) survey data along with the users\u2019 pre-period trading behavior, we next divide our sample of users who trade non-leveraged equities into various sub-samples to examine which groups of users were more likely to alter their trad- ing behavior in response to the fee removal. Specifically, we rerun our main tests after splitting users into groups based on the same user characteristics shown in Table 1: their pre-fee removal trading frequency, years of trading experience at the time of fee removal, age, technological sophistication, account size, and annual income. In Panel A of Table 3, we begin our analysis by partitioning our sample into users whose trading frequency is either below or above the median average monthly number of trades before the fee removal. We find that while the increase in monthly turnover and the number of trades is significant for both subsamples (columns (1)-(4)), it is significantly more pronounced among users who traded more frequently in the pre-period, indicating these users being more sensitive to changes in fee removal. In contrast, in columns (5) and (6), we do not find a significant difference in the trade size response based on the pre-period trading intensity. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604418 Panels B through F of Table 3 present our main tests after partitioning our sample based on various measures that we believe indicate investor sophistication. A consistent pattern emerges across these panels: users with less trading experience, who are younger, less technologically sophisticated, and have lower account size and income, are more likely to modify both their trading intensity and average trade size after the removal of fees. These results from the sub-sample analyses are consistent with users\u2019 misunderstanding of the fee structure in the pre-period, as less sophisticated users are more likely to misunderstand the difference between fixed and variable commission fees.7 The reduction in trade size highlighted in Panel C of Table 2 is also potentially consis- tent with eToro users rationally reducing trade size due to concerns over poorer execution quality for larger trades. However, in Table A4 of the Online Appendix, we find no evidence that execution quality significantly varies with trade size or that the relationship between trade size and execution quality changed after fee removal. Additionally, we find that users decrease trade size for both liquid and illiquid stocks.",

Another possible explanation for the reduced trade size could be that investors incur fixed costs when learning about a particular stock and that fee removal incentivized investors to undertake these fixed costs by reducing the overall cost of investing. However, in Table A5 of the Online Appendix, we find that our trade size results remain qualitatively the same 7Animportantcaveatwheninterpretingthesesubsampleanalysesisthatretailinvestors\u2019tradingbehavior has also been linked to overconfidence (Barber and Odean (2001)), and it would have been interesting to divide our sample based on gender as a proxy for overconfidence.

To the extent that it is more costly to learn about small stocks compared to large ones, the consistency of our results across these two subsamples suggests that our findings are not likely driven by fixed costs associated with information gathering.

One may be concerned that our results could be influenced by eToro users who have multiple brokerage accounts, and who may shift their trading activity from other accounts that still charge commission fees in the post-period to their eToro account. However, in Table A6 of the Online Appendix, we find no significant change in deposit activity by users in treated countries in the post-period relative to those in non-treated countries, suggesting that users are not diverting funds from other accounts into their eToro accounts.

Portfolio Composition We next examine how the removal of fees influenced the composition of users\u2019 portfolios, both in terms of the types of trades eToro customers execute and the characteristics of the equities they include in their portfolios. An important feature of our eToro setting is that it effectively disincentivized leveraged longs and short sales by making non-leveraged trading less expensive in a relative sense. As such, we expect an increased fraction of non- leveragedpositionsinportfoliosofusersintreatedcountries,comparedtoshortandleveraged positions, following the fee removal.

The dependent variable in columns (3) and (4) is theFraction of Positions , which is the proportion of total equity positions held as non- leveraged positions. In columns (1) and (3), we restrict our analysis to our non-leveraged sample, including users who held at least one non-leveraged equity position in the six months preceding fee removal. In columns (2) and (4), we restrict our analysis to a broader sample of equity traders who held at least one non-leveraged, leveraged, or short equity position in the six months leading up to fee removal. Across all columns of Panel A, we find a significant and relatively similar increase in the total equity portfolio value or the total equity positions held as non-leveraged positions by users in treated countries relative to those in non-treated countries. For example, in column (1), we find an increase in the fraction of portfolio value in non-leverage positions of 3.0% relative to a baseline of 74.1%, representing an increase of 4 percent. Collectively, these results are consistent with users shifting toward lower-fee assets in response to the removal of trading commissions.",

Given the popular press allegations of fee removal leading to the gamification of investing, we examine whether eToro customers responded to the fee removal by increasing their holdings in smaller, more speculative stocks, often referred to as \u2018lottery- like\u2019stocks. Toexaminethecharacteristicsofstocksinusers\u2019portfolios, wemeasure Portfolio Average Size as the weighted average log-adjusted market value of equity for all stocks in a user\u2019s portfolio within a given month, Portfolio Average Book-to-Market as the weighted average book-to-market of all stocks in a users\u2019 portfolio within a given month, Portfolio Average Momentum calculated as the weighted average momentum, using the preceding 12- month return, of all stocks in a user\u2019s portfolio within a given month, and Portfolio Average Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604421 MAXas the weighted average of the maximum daily return in the previous month for all stocks in a user\u2019s portfolio, following Bali et al. (2011). Our analyses in Panels B and C of Table 4 show that users in treated countries do not appear to meaningfully change the average size or book-to-market ratio of stocks in their portfolio. In column (1) and column (2) of Panel D, We do see some evidence that eToro customers decrease their reliance on trend-following return momentum strategies to make investment decisions. However, further evidence in columns (3) and (4) suggests that this change is not specific to non-leveraged trades and is therefore less likely to be driven by the fee removal. In Panel E, we find no change in the average MAX, the maximum prior month daily return, of stocks in portfolios of users in treated countries.8While other aspects of retail investors\u2019 trading experience, such as in-app display features, have been shown to cause attention-driven trading (e.g., Barber et al. (2022a)), our results suggest that the removal of commission fees is an unlikely first-order driver of the rise in attention-driven trading among retail investors. 4.3. Portfolio Concentration and Diversification In this section, we provide evidence that investors responded to the fee reduction by decreasing the concentration of their portfolio in a particular stock or industry. Panels A, B, and C of Table 5 report the results for three different measures of portfolio concentration: the number of unique securities held by a user during a given month, denoted Number of Assets; the total number of Fama-French 48 industries represented in a user\u2019s portfolio in a given month, denoted Monthly Number of Industries ; and the average monthly pairwise correlation between the daily returns of all assets held in a users\u2019 portfolio each month, denotedMonthly Average Pairwise Correlation . In columns (1), (3), and (4), we compute trade type specific measures for each trade type 8Similarly, in Table A7 of the Online Appendix, we find no significant changes in the skewness of stocks included in portfolios of users in treated countries in the post-period. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604422 sample. For example, in Panel A column (1), Monthly Number of Assets is measured as the total number of securities specifically held in non-leveraged positions for the non-leveraged sample. In column (2) of each panel, to validate that changes in the concentration of users\u2019 non-leveraged positions had a meaningful effect on these users\u2019 entire equity portfolio, we compute the outcome variable of interest for the non-leveraged sample using all equity posi- tions (non-leveraged, leveraged, and short). Columns (5) and (6) report the triple difference analysis, with the outcome variable being the difference between non-leveraged and leveraged outcome (column (5)) or the non-leveraged and short outcome (column (6)) for users who hold positions in both trade types. The picture emerging across all three panels is clear: in the post-period, users in treated countries hold substantially more diversified portfolios compared to users in non-treated countries, as well as compared to users in treated countries who trade leveraged or short-sale equities that are not subject to the fee removal. Due in part to low pre-period diversification, the fee removal spurred significant changes in diversification.",

        "content": "For example, we find that the average number of unique stocks held in non-leveraged positions over a month increases by 0.715 (column 1 Panel A) from 3.9 (over 18% increase). Additionally, the number of industries represented in the portfolio increased by 0.342 (column 1 Panel B) from 2.40 (over 14% increase). Column (2) of Panels A and B confirms that this increase in diversification of non-leveraged positions also increases overall portfolio diversification. In column (1) of Panel C, we find a significant decrease in the average pairwise correlation across non-leveraged assets in portfolios of users in treated countries relative to the portfolios of users in non-treated countries. However, in column (2) of Panel C, we do not find a significant decrease in the average correlation across all assets in treated users\u2019 portfolios, which seems to be attributed to the lack of the change in the leveraged portion of users\u2019 portfolios. As expected, columns (3) and (4) across all panels do not exhibit significant changes in these measures for leveraged and short positions. The triple-difference analysis in columns (5) and (6) of all panels corroborate these findings, implying that trading fees Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604423 can deter retail investor diversification.9,10 Similar to our analysis of trade intensity and trade size, we next examine which types of users are most likely to adjust their portfolio diversification in response to fee removal. Table 6 presents the results of this analysis, using the same sub-sample distinctions as in Table 3. In Panel A, where we partition our sample to users with trading frequency either below or above the median average monthly number of trades prior to fee removal, we find that high trading frequency users are significantly more likely to increase the number of assets and industries in their portfolio and to hold less correlated assets, compared to low trading frequency users. In Panels B-F, when we use different proxies for users\u2019 sophistication, we find that less sophisticated users tend to increase their portfolio diversification and hold less correlated assets to a greater extent than more sophisticated users. These findings continue to align with the argument that users, particularly less sophisticated ones, misunderstood the fee structure in the pre-fee removal period. Specifically, the results are consistent with capital- constrained investors trading smaller amounts across a wider range of securities in response to perceptions that fee removal disproportionately subsidized smaller positions. 4.4. Fee Removal and New Users While our main research design focuses on the behavior of existing investors (intensive margin), we also document shifts in the entrance of new eToro investors (extensive margin) following the fee removal. Given the age, wealth, and financial sophistication of these new users, it is likely that they are new to investing and not just to eToro. We do so by examining 9Our results hold when users who do not hold more than one asset at any point in the pre-period are excluded. 10As an additional measure of the level of correlation between the returns of assets in a user\u2019s portfolio, we computetheweighted-averagemonthlycorrelationbetweenthedailyreturnsofeachassetinauser\u2019sportfolio and the daily returns of the user\u2019s value-weighted portfolio.

By contrast, the number of users joining eToro in treated countries grew by 172% over the same period (1,263 new users to 3,438 new users). This difference is consistent with fee removal being effective in promoting a surge in new users. Panel A examines the Monthly Number of Trades in months [+4, +6] following the fee removal event month. In Panel A column (5), we find that new users from both treated and non-treated countries, who joined eToro in the three months after the fee removal event month, tend to trade more frequently than those who joined in the three months prior to the fee removal event month. However, the difference in trade intensity of new users from the pre- and post-period is not significantly different when comparing between treated and non-treated countries (Panel A column (6)). Thus, in terms of trade intensity, new users appear similarly affected by fee removal to existing ones. Focusing on users\u2019 trading experience in Panel B in Table 7, we find that the percentage 11An important caveat is that we are unable to observe eToro customers who close their accounts, so our tests focus on newly added accounts around the fee removal period. 12WelimitoursampletothreemonthspostfeeremovaltocaptureuserswholikelyjoinedeToroinresponse to the cancellation of fees. In Table A9 of the Online Appendix, we show that our results remain qualitatively similar when we expand our pre- and post-period sample to six months. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604425 of users who report having no prior trading experience before joining eToro is significantly higher among users in treated countries in the post-period relative to the pre-period. In contrast, in non-treated countries, there is a significant decrease in the percentage of users reporting no trading experience between the pre- and post-periods. Column (6) reports the univariate difference-in-difference analysis. Here, we find that after the fee removal, the percentage of new users in treated countries who reported having no years of trading experience increased by 6.9% in the post-period relative to the percentage of new users in non-treated countries who reported having no years of trading experience in the same period. This suggests that removal of fees attracts less experienced users. Panels C-F provide further supporting evidence that the removal of fees attracted less sophisticated users to join eToro. Panel C shows that after the fee removal, the average age of new users in treated countries in the post-period fell by nearly two years compared to new users in non-treated countries. Panel D shows that the percentage of users with low technological sophistication increased by 4.6% for users in treated countries in the post- period relative to users in non-treated countries in the same period. Panels E and F show thattheaverageaccountsizedecreasedby$878.76andthatthepercentageofusersintreated countries who reported an annual income of less than $50,000 increased by 10.8% relative to new users in non-treated countries in the post-period. Overall, our findings suggest that the removal of trading fees led to a significant surge in eToro user registration, indicating that the removal of fees can be an effective strategy to attract and retain investors. Importantly, this strategy seems to appeal to users who are less sophisticated, younger, and have more modest financial means. These results are consistent with popular press narratives about the increased participation of less sophisticated investors in financial markets.

Parallel Trends, Placebo Test, and Alternative Sample Window Our main difference-in-differences research design relies on the parallel trends assumption (Bertrand et al. (2004), Gow et al. (2016), Cuny et al. (2020)). This assumption underlies the belief that, in the absence of fee removal during our study period, changes in trading behavior would have followed parallel trends. To support this assumption, we plot time- series data of four trading behavior outcome variables for users in both the treated countries and the non-treated countries. The data are presented in Panels A, B, and C in Figures 1 through 4.",

Figure 3 presents time series plots for the Monthly Number of Assets , while Figure 4 presents time series plots for theMonthly Number of Industries . Each of these figures (1 through 4) and their panels (A, B, and C) show that users in both treated and non-treated countries appear to follow parallel trends in the period before the fee removal. In each figure, we observe that the behaviors of affected and unaffected users begin to diverge only after the fee removal. Moreover, this pattern is observable only for non-leveraged trades, which were subject to the fee removal. Overall, these figures show no evidence that the parallel trends assumption is violated and thus strengthen our central conclusion that the removal of fees indeed plays a significant role in altering trading behavior. We perform two additional tests to further explore the parallel trends assumption. In the first test, we follow prior studies and examine the parallel trends assumption using period indicator variables (Angrist and Pischke (2009) and Lechner (2011)). Specifically, we substi- tute the Post\u00d7Treatindicator with separate indicators for each month within our sample, each interacted with the Treatindicator. The fee removal event month is removed from the regression, aligning with our previous analyses. Additionally, the indicator for the month immediately preceding the fee removal event month is removed, serving as our benchmark. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604427 All dependent variables are computed for non-leveraged trades. The results of this analysis are presented in Panel D of Figures 1 through 4. All four figures show no evidence that the parallel trends assumption is invalid. Specifically, the estimated treatment effects are close to zero and statistically indistinguishable from the benchmark period. Subsequently, consistent with the notion that the fee removal impacts users\u2019 trading behavior, we observe that during the post period, users in treated countries exhibit a gradually increasing level of both trade intensity and portfolio diversification, along with a reduction in trade size. Inarelatedtest, wefollowpriorstudiesandemployaplacebotest(AmoreandBennedsen (2013), Derrien and Kecskes (2013), Almeida et al. (2017), and Baik et al. (2022)) to examine the validity of our selection of the period after the fee removal months as our post-period. Specifically, we re-run our panel regressions for each of our main dependent variables, but this time we redefine our Postindicator as equal to one in the six months after a pseudo-fee removal event month, which we set from April 11, 2018 to May 10, 2018, exactly one year before the actual fee removal event month. We focus on the sample period from October 9, 2017 to November 6, 2018 and apply the same sample construction procedure as our initial analysis. Table A10 of the Online Appendix shows little to no evidence of significant changes inouroutcomesofinterestwhenusingalaggedevent-window. Overall, thisanalysissupports our conclusion that it is unlikely for pre-existing trading behavior patterns to explain our results. To provide additional evidence that our results can be attributed to the fee removal event rather than external factors, we shorten our sample window to include only two months prior to and two months after the fee removal event month. In Tables A11-A13 of the Online Appendix, we examine the effects of fee removal on trade intensity and size, portfolio diversification, and portfolio performance within this shortened sample window, spanning from February 11, 2019 to July 10, 2019. Overall, our analysis of the shortened sample window yields similar inferences to those drawn from our more expansive sample window. This suggests that users alter their trading intensity, trade size, and portfolio diversification Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604428 immediately following the fee removal event, further reinforcing our original findings. 5. Fee Removal and Investor Trading Performance We conclude the paper by examining the implications of the fee removal on investor gross returns and net-of-fees return performance. These tests are motivated by the seminal findings of Barber and Odean (2000), which show that despite assuming greater risk, retail investors\u2019 gross investment returns failed to outperform market index returns.",

        "content": "Furthermore, when accounting for transaction costs, investors\u2019 net performance significantly underper- formed. Our study expands on these findings by examining investors\u2019 gross performance and performance net-of-fees, taking into consideration how the presence and subsequent removal of these fees have influenced investor behavior. We begin by examining the aggregate gross performance of the non-leveraged positions of eToro users in both treated and non-treated countries using transactions-based calendar time portfolios approach, following Seasholes and Zhu (2010) and Barber et al. (2022b). This method tests whether purchases (sales) of stocks by users in treated countries predict future positive (negative) returns to a greater extent than those by users in non-treated countries. We first construct BuyandSellportfolios for both treated and non-treated users in both the pre- and post-fee removal period. The Buy(Sell) portfolio purchases a quantity of shares equal to $1/Pit, where Pitis the price of stock iat the close of trading day t, for each purchase (sale) made by users in stock ion datet.13Shares are then held in the portfolio for a specified holding period, denoted by H. The return of portfolio pon day t+ 1is calculated as follows: Rp,t+1=NX i=1witRi,t+1, (2) 13To avoid the daily rebalancing implicit in an equal-weighted strategy, which can lead to positively biased returns (Barber et al. (2022b)), we invest $1/Pitfor each user purchase (sale) in the Buy(Sell) portfolio. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604429 wit=SitPitPSitPit(3) where Ri,t+1is the stock return, witis the weight assigned to each position, and Sitis the total number of shares purchased for stock ion daytand the preceding H-1 days. We repeat this process for positions sold. The amalgamation of these portfolios allows us to test whether the intensity of purchases (or sales) over the past Hdays predicts next day returns. We construct BuyandSellportfolios with holding periods of H\u22085, 25, and 50 days to evaluate whether eToro customers\u2019 net purchases predict shorter- and/or longer-term returns.14We then create a Buys\u2212Sellslong-short portfolio that is long in the Buy portfolio and short in the Sellportfolio for all days in our sample window. This process is executed separately for treated and non-treated users. Our main portfolio of interest, designed to compare the ability of treated versus non-treated users\u2019 trades to predict returns, is constructed to be long in the treated user Buys\u2212Sellsportfolio and short in the non- treated user Buys\u2212Sellsportfolio. We compute daily abnormal returns for this portfolio as the intercept of the regression of the portfolio excess return on the Fama-French five factors, plus a momentum factor. Table 8 presents the results of this analysis. Columns (1), (4), and (7) examine daily portfolios from the pre-fee removal period, whereas columns (2), (5), and (8) investigate the post-fee removal period. Across all holding periods in Table 8, we find no evidence of significant abnormal returns for our portfolio of interest. These findings suggests that, both pre- and post- fee removal, the purchases and sales of users in treated countries neither significantly outperform nor underperform those of users in non-treated countries. Columns (3), (6), and (9) of Table 8 allow for the intercept and coefficients to vary pre- and post-fee removal. Thus, a key takeaway is that we observe no evidence of a difference in abnormal returns between the periods before and after the fee removal. This is consistent 14The average holding period of non-leveraged positions in our sample period is 48 days. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604430 with users demonstrating no deterioration in stock-picking skills in the post-fee removal period. Moreover, in Table A14 of the Online Appendix, we find no significant abnormal returns for either the treated or non-treated Buys\u2212Sellsportfolios in both the pre- and post-fee removal periods. These findings remain robust against alternative holding periods or factor models.15 We next aim to quantify how performance, net of commission fees , changed following the fee removal. To do this, we adjust the returns of our portfolio of interest in Table 8 by the commission fees that would have been paid on such a portfolio with a turnover rate corresponding to its holding period. We find that a portfolio that is long in the treated users\u2019 Buys\u2212Sellsportfolio and short in the non-treated users\u2019 Buy\u2212Sellsportfolio, net of fees, generates significant positive abnormal returns in the post-fee removal period.",

        "content": "This is entirely driven by the fee savings experienced by treated users during the post-fee removal period. As such, the magnitude of the abnormal return naturally increases with increased turnover (i.e., shorter holding period). Nevertheless, we do not tabulate these results because this approach seems poorly suited to estimate the average improvement in net performance experienced by users in treated countries compared to users in non-treated countries. While the Buys\u2212Sellsportfolio approach from Seasholes and Wu (2007) in Table 8 offers insight into the performance of users\u2019 trades by testing whether buys predict positive returns and sells predict negative returns, it does not approximate the average portfolio of a user in the treated and non-treated samples. Instead, the Buys\u2212Sellsportfolios can be interpreted either as the returns to an investor mimicking the trades of users in our sample, or as the inverse of the returns earned by an institution trading against the users in our sample, for example, when fulfilling their orders. In an effort to more accurately approximate changes in the net performance of an average 15Our main portfolio of interest for each of the sub-samples used in Tables 3 and 6 does not show significant abnormal returns within any sub-sample. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604431 user\u2019s portfolio in our sample, we conduct and tabulate tests using user-month level measures of portfolio performance. The tests in Table 9 allow us to examine variation in the average return experienced by eToro users, as opposed to focusing on the most frequently bought and sold positions. Moreover, these tests allow us to better calibrate the effects of commission fees paid in the pre-period and net changes in portfolio turnover in the pre- versus post- periods. It is important to note that these tests suffer from several econometric limitations. For example, Seasholes and Wu (2007) highlights that holdings-based tests are likely to overstate differences in returns because individuals\u2019 portfolio returns are cross-sectionally correlated and are sensitive to small portfolios with limited holdings. In Table 9, we measure the portfolio performance, denoted as Average Return , as the monthly average daily value-weighted raw return of a user\u2019s portfolio. We define the portfolio Average Alpha as the monthly average daily value-weighted alpha of a user\u2019s portfolio. We computethealphaofeachsecurityinauser\u2019sportfolioasthedifferencebetweenthesecurity\u2019s realized return and expected return. We compute expected returns using the Fama-French four factor loadings estimated from the prior 12 months of daily returns. In Panel A of Table 9, we examine the effect of fee removal on users\u2019 performance before adjusting for commission fees paid. In line with the results documented in Table 8, we find no change in the gross portfolio performance between the pre- and post-periods for users in treated countries relative to users in non-treated countries, despite the potentially inflated t-statistics. This finding is also consistent with the evidence documented in Table 4 Panel B, indicating that users do not shift the composition of their portfolio toward smaller, more lottery-like securities. A key takeaway from the collective results in Tables 8 and 9 is that increased trading activity due to fee removal does not noticeably impact retail investors\u2019 gross investment performance, implying that retail investors are not necessarily worse off when trading more frequently. In Panel B of Table 9, we re-examine investor performance, this time adjusting returns Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604432 and alphas for commission fees paid. We find a significant improvement in after-fee monthly returns in the post-period for users in treated countries. The magnitude of 4bps per day in Panel B column (1) is economically meaningful and translates into an annualized return difference of about 11%, which is almost entirely driven by investment losses due to fees in the pre-period. TofurtherconnectourfindingstothoseinBarberandOdean(2000), Figure5replicatesa key figure (Figure 1) in their study. This figure plots the annualized gross and net returns by quintiles of the pre-fee removal average turnover for our non-leveraged sample. To compute the annualized gross returns and annualized net returns, we first sort users into quintiles by their average Monthly Turnover in the pre-fee removal period. Subsequently, we create daily time series of the average user-level daily portfolio gross and fee-adjusted returns for each quintile.",

        "content": "We then compute an average daily return and average daily fee-adjusted return across the pre-fee removal period for each quintile and annualize these average daily returns. Contrary to the findings of Barber and Odean (2000), which indicate minimal variation in gross performance across turnover quintiles, Figure 5 shows an increasing trend in gross performance with trading frequency in our sample. Our data also shows that turnover for the highest quintile is far larger than in Barber and Odean (2000), which is consistent with evi- denceinBarberetal. (2022a)thatmorerecentgenerationsofretailinvestorsdisplaydifferent trading behaviors compared to those from the 1990s. As expected, Figure 5 also exhibits a dramatic decrease in portfolio returns, net of fees, across turnover quintiles. Traders in the lowest turnover quintile earn an average annualized fee-adjusted return of 11.6percent. In stark contrast, traders in the highest turnover quintile experience considerable losses, which translates to an average annualized fee-adjusted return of \u221221.2percent. As in Barber and Odean (2000), the analyses in Figure 5 sort investors based on their trading frequency. However, these tests are not specifically designed to establish a causal relationship between trading intensity and retail investor performance. For example, some Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604433 traders may increase their trading activity after noticing higher returns from their previous trades. Conservely, some may feel compelled to liquidate their positions, thereby increasing turnover, as a result of poor performance. In both scenarios, trading is endogenous to user performance. A key innovation of our study is that we use fee removal as an exogenous shock on retail investor trade demand. We show that users who increase their trading activity in response to the fee removal outperform or underperform compared to unaffected users. Our use of fee removal as an instrumental variable raises concerns regarding the \u201conly-through\u201d condition for identification not holding true in our setting. For example, the removal of fees could influ- ence expected returns via channels beyond increased trading. We cannot completely dismiss this concern, hence our results should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, conventional finance theory posits that expected returns are primarily dictated by risk exposures. We find no evidence in Tables 4 and 8 to suggest that users significantly modify their exposure to standard proxies for expected return (e.g., portfolio bias towards smaller, glamour stocks). This concern is further allayed by the use of alphas in Table 9, which account for standard risk exposures, lending credence to the notion that trading intensity alone is unlikely to be the sole determinant of retail investor performance. 6. Conclusion We study the implications of removing commission fees on trading activity among retail investors, leveragingtheselectiveremovalofthesefeesoneToro, anonlinebrokerageplatform predominantly used by retail investors. Our results suggest that commission fees act as a barrier to participation, trading activity, and diversification for retail investors. These insights contribute to the ongoing regulatory debates concerning retail investors and retail brokerages. By using demographic information, we show that the removal of fees disproportionately Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604434 affected inexperienced investors with smaller deposit amounts and less technological sophisti- cation. This impacted both the number of participating investors (the extensive margin) and the level of trading activity among existing investors (the intensive margin). Importantly, we do not observe any significant change in retail investors\u2019 gross investment performance or holdings of small, lottery-like stocks following the removal of fees. This suggests that increased trading frequency does not necessarily lead to worse outcomes for retail investors.

We exclude the month prior to the fee removal, which serves as the benchmark period. The coefficient estimates (plotted along the x-axis) of each monthly interaction term, along with their corresponding two-tailed 90% confidence in- tervals are plotted.

To compute the annualized gross returns andnet returns, we first sort users into quintiles based on their average Monthly Turnover in the pre-fee removal period. We then form daily time series for the average user-level daily portfolio return and average user-level daily fee- adjusted portfolio return for each quintile. Subsequently, we compute an average daily return and average daily fee-adjusted return for each quintile over the pre-fee removal period for each quintile and then annu- alize the average daily returns. The black bar represents the average Monthly Turnover for each quintile in the pre-fee removal period. The dark gray (light gray) bar denotes the average annualized gross (net) portfolio return during the pre-fee removal period. \u22120.2\u22120.10.00.10.2 \u22122\u22121012 1 2 3 4 5 Quintiles Based on Monthly TurnoverAnnual ReturnMonthly Turnover Turnover Gross Return Net Return Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=422604447 Table 1 Descriptive Statistics This table provides descriptive statistics for the variables used in our analysis for each trade type sam- ple.

Recently, Machine learning (ML) based models have been frequently de ployed to forecast the direction of classic financial time series data. In the 1950s, Hurst Exponent was introduced as a statistical measure to classify various Time Series . This research analyzes the effectiveness of using Machine Learning and Hurst Exponent along with popular Technical Indicators for short term trading prediction s. In this study we explore the use of Hurst Exponent to segment data for a short -term machine learning model in order to improve trading strategy. A comparative analysis has been carried out between the performance of a standalone short -term model, and a Segmented model (Segments based on hurst exponent cut off ) in S&P 500, SSE Composite Indices , Gold SPDR Shares and Bitc oin. This new approach is being introduced in order to reach the optimum integration between Machine learning & Hurst Exponent . Keywords: Short term trading models , Hurst Exponent , Technical Analysis, S&P 500, Machine learning for finance , Financial time series, buy-and-hold, stop -loss, cryptocurrencies , Bitcoin, BTC -USD 1. Introduction The project explores usage of Machine Learning models to perform classification based supervised learning where the outcome of interest is to predict the direction of asset\u2019s movement from short -term perspective. For this purpose, last 10 years of data, essentially covering the post G lobal Financial Crisis era is considered . The research focus es on analyz ing the effectiveness of Machine Learning in trading by breaking the problem into two smaller steps, one to understand the medium -term trend (using Hurst Exponent) , and a machine learn ing model to predict the short -term action (Buy, Sell, None). This study relies on two pillars, the first pillar utilizes Hurst Exponent to understand the medium -term trend. The second pillar utilizes Machine Learning, (Technical Indicator based Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine and Xgboost Classifier models ) to predict the short -term trend . The amalgamation between Hurst Exponent output -based segmentation and Machine Learning is the first approach. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3824032 2. Theoretical Framework 2.1 Literature Review In 1951, British hydrologist, Harold Edwin Hurst introduced Hurst Exponent which quantifi es the long-term memory of a time series. Varying between 0 to 1 it explores the autocorrelations and lags in a Time Series. Hurst proposed that H = 0.5 represents no correlation which implies no association between the current value and the past values of the series. For H between 0 to 0.5 , the series behaves in a mean reverting fashion alternating between highs and lows. As hurst exponent approaches zero, the series mean reverting strength increases. When H is between 0.5 to 1 it implies l ong term, positive correlation displaying a rather consistent movement in upward or downward direction . Such series show trend for some time, and then may see a certain abrupt disruption. As value approaches one, the series trend behavior becomes dominant. The Hurst Exponent method from hydrology was later introduced and explored in other fields by Mandelbrot & Ness [2], Mandelbrot [3] and others. Peters [4] introduced Fractal Markets Hypothesis (FMH) which affirms non-normality and autocorrelation of asse t returns. FMH allows for a broader range of returns \u2019 behavior . Some other papers which explored the use of Hurst Exponent for financial series are: Lipka and Los (2002) [5] explored Hurst Exponent\u2019s ability to measure long term dependence in data series for eight European stock market Indices. Lipka and Los observed that the FTSE100 returns represent highly -efficient market with rapid mean reversion compared to a Geometric Brownian Motion. Corazza and Malliaris (2002) [6] explored the application of Hurst Exponent in the forex markets . Corazza and Malliaris found Hurst Exponent to be significantly different from 0.5 in many of the samples. The authors also observed that Hurst Exponent value for foreign currency markets change over time, and is not fixed.",

        "content": "This could indicate that foreign exchange markets are inefficient, compared to their equity peers. Cajueiro and Tabak (2004) [7] used a rolling window approach in order to calculate Hurst Exponent to assess the efficiency of 11 emerging markets and compare the same with US and Japan (which are assumed to be efficient markets). The y found that Asian equity markets show less efficiency than Latin America n markets , whereas the developed markets are more efficient (Hurst Exponent = 0.5). Mitra [8] explored the values of Hurst Exponent over varying window sizes. They analy zed the value of Hurst Exponent for twelve stock index series for past 10 years. The author showed that in long window sizes th e Hurst Exponent value is very close to 0.5, but over small window sizes of 60 days, its value varies widely. Mitra observed the correlation between H-value and returns , and hence H-value can be used in tandem with Technical Analysis. The authors summarize d that though H -value in itself might not predict the direction of a trend, but when H value is high then trend detecting rules could provide higher returns. In [9] authors showed that irregularities in the series, such as jumps or spikes lead to inappro priate scaling and hence an incorrect estimation of the Hurst Exponent. The authors also pointed out the statistical error while measuring Hurst Exponent in the presence of self- affine fractal scaling. Kirichenko, Radivilova, and Deineko [10] described different methods that are the commonly used for estimating the Hurst exponents (R /S-analysis, detrended fluctuation Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3824032 3 analysis (DFA) , variance -time analysis, and wavelet -based estimation). The results showed that the estimates of the H exponent ar e biased which depend on the true value of the degree of self-similarity of the process as well as the length of Time Series. Morales, Matteo, Gramatica, and Aste [11] investigated the use of the Hurst Exponent, computed over a cascading time-window, to e valuate the level of stability of financial firms. Financial firms bailed -out post the 2007 -2010 credit crisis show a clear incre ment in generalized Hurst Exponent in the period prior to crisis. Existing research shows that estimation of Hurst Exponent ove r smaller time frames is volatile, and needs to be handled with care. Though on a long -term basis the markets are efficient and have Hurst Exponent of 0.5, the smaller term tells a different story. It is not new for researchers to find the stocks and sto ck market indices appealing from prediction perspective. While it all begins as a researcher\u2019s quest to solve this problem, there are many involved parties in the market that get affected by the outcomes, and hence the ability to foresee potential market movements in the short to medium term horizon could present lucrative trade opportunities. There are two broad approaches: First approach assumes that the index has everything baked -in i.e. the index at time t represented by \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc61 is a composite of v arious underlying factors , hence , we only consider this value to be meaningful while predicting a future value after k time intervals \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58. This is time series analysis -based approach. Second approach attempts to explore the relationship of the form \ud835\udc4c=\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) where the index Y is seen as the Effect of certain causal factors or Xs. Here we attempt to understand the explanatory variables which in turn help us predict the response Y. This is Machine Learning based approach where we try to create various mod els and choose the ones which serve high and sustainable accuracy while predicting the historical as well as future outcomes of interest. This is the approach we intend to explore in our project. We explored the existing work done by various researchers in this area. In the paper [12] published by Pyo S 2017 various technical indicators were modelled using non-parametric machine learning models like ANN, and SVM with polynomial as well as RBF kernel. In addition, interesting hypotheses were formulated and validated e.g.",

This paper takes [13] as a reference and calls out the experimental procedures used in [13] impractical to investors because while deciding the training and test data time series nature of the data was completely discarded. Another interesting rese arch in this area [14] by Qui M 2016 for the NIKKEI 225 focuses on creating same model on two non -overlapping input sets, wherein the optimization of single hidden layer ANN using Genetic Algorithm substantially improves the predictive power measure in ter ms of Hit Ratio. Thus, the right features and a tuned model seems to work. However, there are many uncertainties and apprehensions, these approaches have not been applied on the index we are trying to predict. Also, markets evolve over a period of time, for example, the GFC had an impact which lasted a few years, whereas during the pandemic which is the worst ever crisis we are witnessing in our lifetime, the markets took just a few months to bounce back. Therefore, the stage at which the predictions are being done and the markets considered in scope could also have a bearing on the performance of quantitative algorithms. Martinez, Lisana B [15] 2018 consider ed the impact of financial crisis on the 6 EU countries , found that stocks seem to respond to the crisis built -up in a smoother way Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3824032 compared to the bonds this is validated using the Hurst Exponent. But we can\u2019t say the same holds good for the pandemic because the time to react in this case was rather limited. The same is found in the research carried out by [16] Matthieu Garcin 2020. In [17] authors propose a modern deep learning approach integrating wavelet transforms (WT) along with stacked auto -encoders (SAEs) , and long -short term memory (LSTM) for stock price forecasting. The deep learning framewo rk comprises three stages. In first stage the stock price information decomposed using wavelet transform to remove noise. In second stage auto -encoders are used to generate feature set while minimizing root mean square error between input and output. In fi nal stage of the framework, the authors used an LTSM model to predict the subsequent day's closing price. The performance of the model was compared for six different market indices and the results showed that the model outperformed the similar approaches in both profitability and predictive accuracy. In [18] study focuses on use of deep learning to predict future stock prices. The authors designed a deep learning model with 715 inputs based on technical analysis. They also filtered the data pattern in price fluctuations to get similar data input to models. Different combinations of input features and target vectors were explored to understand the performance of deep learning for stock price prediction. This [20] paper presented a comparative study for ARIMA, Neural Networ k, and stochastic geometric Brownian motion for stock price. Their r esearch concludes that compared to the neural network model, the statistical mo del, and the stochastic model perform better at predicting next day stock price . In [21] the authors explore the usage of feature selection for data processing using two neural networks for predicting return s, and a simple rule -based system to integrate the two on S&P500. The purpose of this study was to explore if more systematic data filtering and return integration can bring improvement s. Multiple combinations were explored a nd validated for 5-year trading period. 2.2 Competitor Analysis There are multiple research papers on use of Hurst Exponent for trading, and to identify market cycles. Existing research shows that Hurst Exponent is widely used in the time series data pertaining to physical systems, healthcare and finance. Use of machine learning in Short term trading is a well -documented field. Wang [22] used PCA -SVM integrated model to predict the stock market indices. Both internal and external financial factors were explored in the model.",

        "content": "One major drawback of the given approach is using 1 for price increase, and -1 for price decrease. The third state of oscillations is not being considered. In [23] Qian, & Rasheed explore the use of Hurst Exponent as an indicator fo r short term trading. Though the exponent may be a good indicator but given today\u2019s common use of quant algorithms, a simple rule -based system might not offer an edge in the market. Chenoweth, and Obradovic in [21] built a two layered structured model wher e the incoming data is divided into market trends, and then a prediction model using neural networks. The major shortcoming of this system is that the medium -term trend indicator is based on a simple rule, and one major drawback of ANNs is that the perform ance on unseen samples declines rapidly when the ANN model is over -fitted to training observations e.g. the nois e in stock information could encourage ANNs to create a rather complex model which overfits. Our novel approach explore s the use of Hurst Expone nt as a market trend Indicator. It has been further observed that while Hurst Exponent in itself might not directly predict the direction, in combination with technical analysis, can show better efficiency in the short term when H is approximately equal to 0.5. Also, in small window sizes (which is more relevant for Short term trading, and medium -term trend), Hurst Exponent estimation is Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3824032 5 biased. Therefore, using technical indicators as predictors in short term model seems logical. The study also explore s if the window size affect s the accuracy of medium -term trend . During literature review we didn\u2019t come across any one stop solution that utilized combination of Hurst Exponent and Technical Indicators using two separate models for medium and short term. Toge ther with this we are breaking the problem into simple steps where we are benchmarking Machine Learning classification models on short term between one single model versus Hurst Exponent based segmented models . In most research we came across, the research ers use the absolute value to define uptrend or down -trend. We shall explore a more dynamic way of defining a trend in short -term using rolling average standard deviation; rather than a fixed approach of either a certain percentage increase/decrease or just simple increase or decrease. Our proposed system also accounts for an oscillation phase in markets. The same period is skipped entirely with no traditional activity. 3. Methodology 3.1 Data The data sample is focusing on last 10 years of data of S&P500 index , SSE Composite index , Gold (SPDR Gold Shares), and Bitcoin USD (BTC -USD) . Data was gathered from Yahoo finance. SSE Composite Index is the most commonly used indicator to reflect SSE's market performance. Constituents for the SSE Composite Index are all listed stocks (A shares and B shares) at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. S&P500 represe nts Free -float capitalization -weighted index in US Market. SPDR Gold shares seek to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the expenses of the Trust operations. The Trust holds gold bars and from time to time, issues Baskets in exchange for deposits of gold and distributes gold in connection with redemptions of Baskets. Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency which uses peer -to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is c arried out collectively by the network. The whole sample was split into two sets, training set, and test set. The structure for model validation, and testing is defined below. \u201cCross Validation\u201d technique implemented in scikit -learn package was used for model selection in Grid Search. The quant strategy was tested with out of time sample as below: Figure 1.

After selecting optimal window size, two new variables were defined; 1. Ratio of Number of days with increase in value over last day to days with decrease in value over last day (Gives an indication of trend behaviour of time series), 2. Ratio of number of days when the price went from increasing to decreasing to number of days it went from decreasing to increasing (gives an indication of mean reversion behaviour of time series). Plotting above variables for different value s of Hurst Exponent, a cut -off was estimated to divide the data into two segments. 3.3 Model Selection Roadmap Most research in stock trading using quant models focus es on single stage models to predict next day closing prices. Our unique approach is to break down the problem in two components, one using Hurst Exponent to identify trending behaviour and then over lay that with a specific model to define the trading strategy over short term . Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3824032 7 Figure 2. Overall process flow for the trading strategy The performance for the strategies has been compared for S&P 500, which being a developed and mature market is considered efficient , SSE Composite (China) which is a developing market and is semi -efficient , Gold as a representative of a mature commodities market and Bitcoin, which is emerging cryptocurrency market in early stages (mature compared to other cryptocur rencies available in market). 1. Option 1: Use of Hurst Exponent (H) to establish a medium -term behavior, build and train specific models for mean reverting, and trending component for short term trading. Using Hurst Exponent as an Indicator for market in medium term memory of the series. Figure 3. Hurst Exponent based Segmented Model approach 2. Option 2: In this option the whole dataset was used to build a short term trading model. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3824032 Figure 4. Machine Learning Model (without segment) The above two structures differ basis the use of medium -term trading model. The first one explores the use of Hurst Exponent to identify the medium -term trend, whereas in the second , a short -term machine learning model has been built on whole dataset . The classification objective for short t erm model was defined in below manner: Step 1: Calculate last 20 trading days rolling window standard deviation Step 2: Calculate upper and lower bound for next 5 days as: \u2022 Upper bound = Current day price + 1 standard deviation \u2022 Lower bound = Current day price \u2013 1.5 standard deviation Step 3: The classification variable is tagged as: \u2022 1: if the stock price (or Index value) breaches the upper limit in next 5 days \u2022 -1: if the stock price (or Index value) breaches the lower limit in next 5 days \u2022 Else 0 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3824032 9 Figure 5.

We tried to address this area in our current project. The trading structure results have been compared with one another, and a basic simple strategy of Buy and Hold. 3.4 Trading Strategy Our trading strategy is based on the outcome of Short -term model, which can give a Buy Signal, a Sell Signal or No Action. A position is initiated based on the model output and is kept open for a maximum of 5 days. If neither the target or stop loss is hit in next 5 days, the position is closed. In case the model gives a n opposite direction within those 5 days Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3824032 (before target o r stop loss is hit), the position is closed and opposite position is opened. More details can be found below: 1.

Results Data for S&P 500 , SSE Composite Indices , SPDR Gold Shares and Bitcoin (BTC -USD) were downloaded from Yahoo Finance from Jan 01, 2011 to Dec 31, 2020. Based on the Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3824032 11 below plot, Hurst Exponent with window size of 200 was selected for segmentation. Hurst Exponent is very volati le with window size of 100, but from window size 200 onwards the trend remains same, and it grows smoother with higher window sizes. Hence, 200 days trading window was chosen to calculate Hurst Exponent for medium -term trend. Detailed graphs for each asset can be found in [24]. Figure 8. Hurst Exponent for different window sizes for S&P 500 After selecting the optimal window size, Trend ratio variable, and Zero Cross rate variable (as described in section 3.2) were plotted to estimate Hurst Exponent threshold to divide data into segments. For S&P 500, SSE Composite and Gold , based on Hurst Exponent with window size 200 trading days, the cut off was estimated at 0.6 , and for BTC -USD 0.735 was defined as threshold. Among the asset classes, Bitcoin behaved most differently.",

For Bitcoin, both approaches (Segmented model, and non -segmented model) had same win ratio of 3/3. For SSE Composite Index the performance was reversed i.e. Segmented model performed Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3824032 better than non -segmented model in only one scenario out of six. In most scenarios (for all assets), the segmented appro ach also helped reduce the maximum drawdown on daily basis compared to non -segmented approach. The codes for the project can be found at [24]. 5. Discussions Hurst Exponent based segmentation approach was more profitable than non -segmented approach for S&P 500, and Gold SPDR shares assets, and performed poorly for SSE Composite Index . For Bitcoin, both segmented and non -segmented approach performed equally, but Hurst Exponent based segmentation had a lower maximum drawdown. S&P 500, and Gold are both mat ure markets. SSE Composite is developing market, and Bitcoin in an emerging market. The models were built using data from 2011 to 2018 to train and validate the model, and score the selected model on 2019 -2020 data.",

Bock1and Akhilesh Maewal2 1Independent, New Braunfels, T exas, USA 2Independent, San Diego, California, USA January 4, 2023 Abstract A system for sector rotation swing trading of exchange-traded funds (ETF s) using deep learning is presented. W eekly trades are made on funds representing 11 major sectors of the U.S. economy . The trading system was backtested for the period January 2012 through December 2022. Annualized CAGR returns exceeded the benchmark buy-and-hold strategy by an average 12.63% (median 7.63%). Of particular note is the positive alpha (\u03b1= 28 .4%) achieved in trading for 2022, a difficult year for stocks in which the S&P 500 index experienced a CAGR loss of 18% . Over the studied period, Sharpe ratios averaged 1.39, and the mean maximum drawdown was 10%. The deep model design is multiple-input, multiple output, and can be easily extended to include other factors that may influence predictability of future price movements. The results presented here are preliminary , and are exclusive of trading costs. Analysis of these costs is prerequisite to deployment as a semi-mechanical swing trading system. 1 Introduction Sector rotation refers to a portfolio rebalancing strategy wherein money is moved from one economic sector into another, to profit from differential financial performance of different sectors mapped to stages of the business cycle [3]. The cycles follow the sequence: [trough ,expansion ,peak,contraction ], before repeating again. The idea is to identify and anticipate the timing of each phase based on macroeconomic indicators, and allocate assets accordingly [10]. F or quantitative trading, business cycle timing is problematic. Incorrect prognosis may result in trading out- of-phase, yielding capital losses, or at least underperformance relative to a simple long position in a broad market index. In studies of quarterly switching between index funds of two asset classes (U.S. stocks and bonds) over the period 1993-2017, it was concluded that the optimal timing of rotation between classes was ``indistinguishable from a random sequence\" [16]. Even given perfect forecasting of cycles, researchers found at best a 2.3% outperformance relative to the market using a conventional sector rotation strategy [12]. Their study covered multiple economic expansions and contractions over the years 1948\u20132007. Industrial momentum strategies for sector rotation eliminate the need to time the market, and may produce outperformance, especially when rebalanced in the short term [17]. In one recent study , industrial momentum strategies with various holding periods were examined on a large historical sample spanning years 1926-2018. U.S. industry portfolios were sorted into quintiles of returns from the previous month. Portfolios comprising industries with the highest previous\u2010month returns were found to produce significantly greater profits than the groups having underperformed in previous month [11]. The present work takes a different strategic approach to short-term sector rotation trading. Deep learning models are developed to inform buy decisions on exchange-traded funds (ETF s) representing the major sectors U.S. economy . F or each trading year, a multi-input, multi-output model is trained on recent historical price, volume and auxiliary economic data to make recommendations on which sectors are most likely to increase in value over the next trading week. Selected funds are ranked, curated and bought at Monday market open, and all holdings are liquidated at close of the current trading week. Within-year models are incrementally updated each week. In the short term, ETF price movements exhibit volatility; this can be exploited for tactical asset allocation. Results of backtesting the current trading strategy are presented for the period January 2012 through December, 2022. Exclusive of trading costs, CAGR outperformance over the benchmark S&P 500 index was found to be meaningful (mean \u03b1= 12.63%, median = 7.63%). 1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4280640Related work Machine and deep learning techniques as applied to portfolio allocation and trading are abundant in the literature. A selected review of reports relevant to the present work is provided here. Navon and Keller [18] developed a deep learning-based system to predict price trends of stocks and ETF s. These predictions were used for intraday trading using a ``buy-sell-hold\" strategy . Potential open positions were evaluated for likelihood of profitability by thresholding probabilistic neural network outputs. Positions were closed based on forecast changes in price trend.",

        "content": "Backtesting over two years, cumulative returns from trading certain large-cap stocks generally outperformed broad market index. The present research was informed by [18] where it was suggested that prediction accuracy could be improved by making dynamic model updates using all available at a point in time. This idea is implemented in the strategy reported here. In Liew and Mayster [15], ETF price movements were forecast using machine and deep learning models. Predic- tion horizons of one and three months' duration were found to produce best results in terms of a ``gain criterion\" comparing model price forecast accuracy against random inputs. No explicit financial results were reported. One conclusion was that ETF price movements were essentially unpredictable at very short horizons (one to five days) [15]. Findings in the present report contradict this assertion; it will be shown that over a one-week trading horizon, profitability is indeed possible using a deep learning strategy . Chalkidis and Savani [5] applied several machine learning techniques (including random forests and deep net- works) to financial time series prediction. Models were trained to output one of three decisions on price movement-- down, up, or slightly in either direction, corresponding to short, long and abstain positions. A trading strategy for commodities futures based on these ``selective classification\" models with different feature sets was designed, and subjected to backtesting. By including an ``abstain\" position, the selective classification approach outperformed non-selective (binary) classifiers, and resulted in smaller capital losses in trading due to reduced misclassifications. Pinelis and Ruppert [20] used random forest models for portfolio adjustment on a monthly basis. Their models simultaneously forecast both expected returns and volatility . Results produced improved returns ( \u03b1= 3.37% ) over a buy-and-hold strategy . The authors speculate that further performance gains might be achieved by use of deep learning. Sauer [21] studied investment strategies, using random forests to identify economic regimes based on monthly GDP data. Portfolio sector weights between cyclical and defensive assets were modified according to the identified regime. It was concluded that for trading, machine learning did not significantly improve results compared to a na\u00efve strategy using equal weights for sectors. Additional work on deep learning methods for financial applications is surveyed in [19]. Present contribution The key contributions made in this research are proposed as follows: \u2022 A robust system for sector rotation swing trading using deep learning. A single model architecture, set of training hyper-parameters and trading rules generalizes to all years considered (2012-2022). \u2022 Consistent outperformance over the benchmark buy-and-hold strategy . \u2022 A statistically-based estimate of confidence in each putative trade. \u2022 Coverage includes all major sectors of U.S. economy , with each sector potentially bought in a trading week. Custom models are developed within each year, and updated dynamically using the latest observed price and volume data. \u2022 The deep model design is multiple-input, multiple output and extendable to include other technical indicators or economic factors that may impact future price movements. 2 Methods The trading system comprises three elements: (1) historical price and volume data for major economic sector ETF s; (2) a deep learning model trained to forecast future price movements using this data; and (3) a trading strategy based on the out-of-sample predictions made by the model. 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42806402.1 Data preparation The ETF s selected as the basis for development of the trading strategy in this study are listed in T able 1. As a whole, these funds cover the major industrial sectors of the United States economy . Price and volume data for each fund were acquired from Y ahoo Finance\u2020. In addition to the ETF price and volume data, ancillary economic data (10 year U.S. T reasury yield, USD currency index, crude oil proxy and market volatility indicators) were collected, under the hypothesis they might provide additional informative context to the model. In some experiments, these extra data were as model inputs, and were not actively traded quantities. The final results reported here are based only on model inputs comprising the sector funds of T able 1. Sector ETF and auxiliary data were sampled at discrete points in time, and filtered to exclude all but ``F riday close\" prices.",

The model was designed to process multiple inputs and make predictions for each sector-based asset as described in Section 2.1. After considerable experimentation with different architectures, the final model used here was composed of four fully connected internal layers, each followed by ReLU activation [14] and dropout [24], now standard techniques used to mitigate vanishing gradients and over-fitting on the training data, respectively . The output layer was likewise densely connected, and was terminated with a linear activation function. Model optimization and dynamic update Individual models were trained and evaluated for trading years from January 2012 through December 2022 . Each model was fit using historical data from the previous 2 years. After training, the models were used to recommend purchases of sector ETF s once per week in the succeeding trading year.

T o connect dynamic model optimization with financial performance, a custom loss function incorporating recent capital gains and losses was used to steer model weights updates in the direction of profitable trades. The idea of directly using a financial criterion was suggested in [4]. Models were developed used the T ensorFlow platform [1] and the Keras deep learning API [6]. Evaluation of trading performance At trading year-end, overall performance of executed trades was evaluated using financial performance statistics including compound annual growth rate (CAGR), the Sharpe ratio [22], and the maximum drawdown of the portfolio. Present results are compared against the benchmark strategy of full investment in the S&P 500 ( SPX ) for a given trading year.",

Assign confidence metric to distribution of predictions for each asset. 3. Apply loss reduction heuristics to refine the selection set. 4. Rank funds in list, and allocate available capital. 5. Update model using the observed week data xt. \u2022 On Monday open (week t+ 1 ): \u2013 Buy : Buy sector ETF s as designated in week t. Generation of ``buy\" signal The trading model produces a vector of real numbers, one for each sector ETF from the collection listed in T able 1. A preliminary buy decision is made by comparing each output value to a threshold value unique to the corresponding asset. Surpassing this value is taken as a ``buy\" signal; otherwise, the fund is not bought. The threshold vector is updated dynamically after each trading week, and is estimated by optimizing a cost function based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis [8] of recently observed input data. Scheduled selling All positions are liquidated just before market close in the current trading week. While perhaps counter-intuitive, this systematic approach eliminates potential situations where even the professional investor's selling decisions may perform worse than a random selling strategy [2]. Confidence estimation It has been noted that neural network predictions can be ``\u2026very noisy and unreliable\"[4]. This assertion was corroborated in the present research, where point estimates of future price movements were observed to be highly variable, and distributed non-uniformly over successive experimental runs. A confidence measure was implemented by using a technique termed ``Monte Carlo dropout\" [9] applied to the output layer in the model. A large number of predictions is made for each asset, for each trading week; each prediction is made with a random group of connection weights nullified. In effect, this produces an ensemble of deep models. F or each asset s, the statistical distribution of predictions \u02c6ysfor the ensemble is analyzed. Greater confidence is assigned to forecasts where a significant portion (here, 80%) of the probability mass of the distribution \u02c6Psis located within one standard deviation of the population median. A dispersed distribution in contrast presents greater uncertainty , and the associated asset is not purchased. Loss reduction heuristics Greater psychological discomfort accrues from losses than does pleasure realized from equivalent financial gains [25]. Loss aversion strategies are essential for swing trading to limit short-term losses. Additional filters may be applied to the ETF s marked for purchase in the ensuing week. Filters are parameterized to align with trader's level of loss aversion. These include loss limits at the single trade or complete portfolio level. Actions taken upon exceedance may dictate removal of a symbol from the buy list, or halting of all trading for the current week. Stop limiting conditions and consequent strategic actions used in the backtesting experiments are summarized in T able 2. Condition V alue Time Action Recent loss by symbol 5% week Remove ETF from buy list Maximum loss, week-week $300 week Halt trading one week Portfolio underwater 5% Q4 Halt trading one week Maximum loss by symbol 27.5% Q1-Q4 Remove ETF from buy list Minimum win rate by symbol 45% Q4 Remove ETF from buy list T able 2: Loss mitigation conditions and resulting actions used in backtesting experiments. Dynamic allocation of capital Prior to a trading week, available capital is distributed to each sector fund based on total average investment performance to date (win rate), and on momentum of trades in the sector [17].",

Discussion T rading results from the present deep strategy demonstrate non-trivial outperformance for over one decade of backtesting. By using only two years' training data, and incrementally refreshing the models with newly observed data at the end of each trading week, the variance between backtesting and out-of-sample performance can be mitigated. Previous authors [26] suggested that too many backtests increase overfitting, reducing the generalization ability of financial forecasts. That observation was based on a ``fit-once, forecast all\" approach, which does not apply to the continuous updating trading scheme followed here. The densely-connected multiple-input, multiple-output model learns to approximate a function connecting prices and volumes in each major sector of the economy with their future values. Nonlinear interactions between prices across (perhaps linearly uncorrelated) sectors are represented. Results obtained here agree with previous findings of evidence for a universal structure of price formation in high-frequency trading, where deep models trained on all stocks were seen to outperform stock-specific ones [23]. Regarding labeling of the training data, declaring a minimum 1% increase in next week's price as the target positive class was arrived at in order to approximately balance the examples for classification. A more accurate threshold value could be determined with further analysis. The model learns to approximate the target function even with misclassification errors, in part due to the error signal provided by the loss function which includes capital gains or losses from the previous weeks' trading. 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4280640Returns reported here are exclusive of ETF trading costs. Commissions (minimal), changes in underlying net asset values, operating expenses, and bid/ask spreads all affect the total cost of ETF ownership.

Coverage of potential trades each week includes 11 major sectors of the U.S. economy . A single model architecture, set of training hyper-parameters and trading rules was used in backtesting covering the period January 2012 through December 2022. The model design is multiple-input, multiple output and can be easily extended to include other technical indicators or economic factors that may influence predictability of future price movements. Based on annualized CAGR, returns exceeded the benchmark strategy on average by 12.63% (median 7.63%). Sharpe ratios averaged 1.39, indicating reasonable return-to-risk from trades execution. Mean maximum drawdown of the dynamic portfolio was 10% for the studied period. The results presented here are preliminary , and not inclusive of real-world trading costs. Analysis of these costs is obviously prerequisite to deployment as a semi-mechanical swing trading system.

The present study is aimed to identify the factors affecting to the personal financial management behaviour of lower income people. There are four va riables used in this study namely, financial knowledge, financial attitude and external locus of control (independent variable) and personal financial management behaviour (dependent variable). The primary data were collected through structured questionnai re from 360 lower income people located in Manmunai North Division of Batticaloa. The collected data was analysed by using univariate and regression analysis. Based on the finding of the study, it concludes that there is a low level of financial knowledge and financial attitude and high level of external locus of control. On other hand, level of personal financial management behaviour among lower income people indicates the lower level. Factors such as financial knowledge and financial attitude have signifi cant and positive effect on lower income peoples\u2019 personal financial management behaviour while, external locus of control significantly and negatively affect personal financial management behaviour of lower income people in Manmunai North Divisional Secre tariat Area.

Background of the Study The financial systems of the 21st Century have been growing with speed, sophistication and becoming more complex world over (Hilgert & Hogarth, 2002). People have increasing interest to tak e individual responsibility for their financial dealings unlike in the past, financial problems resulting from poor personal financial management is known to affect people day to day family life, individual productivity at work place and wellbeing of socie ty. There is a lack of understanding of financial systems and the complexity of financial products and services. Lack of knowledge on various financial concepts can be linked to basic standard financial behaviours and practices such as lack of planning for retirement, lack of participation in the stock market, and bad borrowing behaviour (Basu, 2005). It is becoming increasingly important for individuals to take personal responsibility for their financial affairs, for instance, in accessing education, meeti ng basic needs and health care. The economic as well as the social environment in which people make financial decisions have continued to change significantly. The ability and knowledge to manage one\u2019s personal finance has become increasingly essential to day. Personal financial success is determined by the ability of individuals to manage their savings, spending, and investments of their financial resources (Garman & Forgue, 2011). Sri Lanka has achieved a high level of financial inclusion compared to othe r South Asian countries. Its financial sector comprises a wide range of financial institutions providing financial services such as loans, savings, leasing, pawning and finance, and remittance and money transfer facilities. In Sri Lanka, and with the grow ing information technology \u2013finance nexus, financial awareness and education have become all the more important (ADBI, 2017). Financial knowledge, skills, awareness, and attitude are needed for people to make informed financial decisions. Therefore, persona l finance management is playing an important role in household of Sri Lanka. Thus, research sought to study the factors affecting on personal finance management behaviour of lower income people in Manmunai North Division of Batticaloa. Research Problem Empirical evidence suggests a high level of financial access in Sri Lanka. With the growth and expansion of financial institutions in the post -2000 period, households accessing multiple financial institutions have become a common phenomenon in Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "T ilakaratna (2012) found that, on average, the share of households accessing multiple financial institutions for their credit and savings needs had increased from an already high level of 60.2% in 2006 \u20132007 to around 84.0% by 2009 \u20132010. The average number o f financial institutions accessed by one household increased from 1.9 in 2006 \u2013 2007 to 3.0 in 2009 \u20132010. According to Asian Development Bank Institution (2017), around 68% of households in the lowest income quintile had accessed multiple financial instit utions, compared with more than 90% in the highest income quintile. Increasing levels of multiple borrowing (i.e., households borrowing from multiple financial institutions) has become an issue of concern in Sri Lanka\u2019s financial sector. While household ac cess to multiple financial institutions suggests a high level of financial inclusion in the country, empirical evidence Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3863769 Sovitha andThavakumar The Journal of Business Studies 0 4(02)2020 3 shows that household debt levels have enlarged to 15.3% by 2009 -2010, particularly among households that borrow from multiple financial institutions (ADBI, 2017). The poor personal financial management behaviour is affected by several factors. However, in Sri Lankan context, there were a dearth of studies have been undertaken to identify the factors affecting on personal financial manageme nt behaviour among lower income people and there is an empirical knowledge gap. Therefore, to fulfil the empirical gap, this study examines the factors affecting personal financial management behaviour in Manmunai North Division of Batticaloa . \u201cWhat are th e factors affecting personal financial management behaviour of low -income people in Manmunai North Division of Batticaloa?\u201d Research Questions This study attempts to answer the following questions: What is the level of financial knowledge, financial attitu de, external locus of control and lower income peoples\u2019 personal financial management behavior? To what extent do financial knowledge, financial attitude and external locus of control affect personal financial management behavior? Research Objectives The o bjectives of the study were, To determine the level of financial knowledge, financial attitude, external locus of control and lower income peoples\u2019 personal financial management behavior To assess the extent to which financial knowledge, financial attitude and external locus of control affect personal financial management behavior. 2. Literature Review Personal Financial Management Behaviour Financial management behaviour is considered one of the key concepts on the financial discipline. Horne and Wachowicz (2002) propose financial management behaviours as the determination, acquisition, allocation, and utilization of financial resources, usually with an overall goal in mind. Weston and Brigham (1981) describe financial management behaviour as an area of fin ancial decision - making, harmonizing individual motives and enterprise goals. Joo (2008) indicates that effective financial management behaviour should improve financial well -being positively and failure to manage personal finances can lead to serious long term, negative social & societal consequences. Thus, financial management is mainly concerned with the effective funds management. Financial Knowledge and Personal Financial Management Behaviours Financial knowledge, for the purpose of this study is define d as, \u201cThe ability to make informed judgments and to take effective decisions regarding the use and management of money\u201d. The relationship of these two variables is conclusive; with all studies find that having financial knowledge does influence individual s to behave in a more financially responsible way (Robb & Woodyard, 2011; Zakaria et al., 2012). The people Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3863769 Sovitha andThavakumar The Journal of Business Studies 0 4(02)2020 4 who are financially knowledgeable are more likely to behave in financially responsible way (Hogarth & Hilgert, 2002). Regarding the empirical suppor t, previous studies agree on the significance of having financial knowledge and responsible financial behaviour (Hilgert, Hogarth & Beverly, 2003; Perry & Morris, 2005; Chen & Volpe, 1998). Chen and Volpe (1998) found that poor financial knowledge of fina ncial issues such as investment, savings and spending fundamentals are the most common problem encountered by people experiencing financial problems. Similarly, a study shows that savings, an indicator of responsible financial behaviour is also determined by financial literacy (Lusardi, Mitchell & Curto, 2010). According to Lusardi and Mitchell (2008), literature shows that basic knowledge is tied to more efficient financial behaviour such as planning and saving for retirement.",

        "content": "Several studies have shown th at financial literacy positively related to self -beneficial financial behaviour (Hilgert, Hogarth, & Beverly, 2003). Based on the above empirical evidence, this study develops the following hypothesis. H1: Financial knowledge is significantly and positivel y affect lower income people\u2019s personal financial management behaviour. Financial Attitude and Personal Financial Management Behaviours Financial attitude for the purpose of this study defined as \u201cthe application of financial principles to create and maintain value through decision making and proper resource management. Attitude is defined as \u201cpsychological tendency that is expressed by va luating a particular entity with some degree of favour or disfavour (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). A number of researches have concluded that financial attitudes play an important role in determining a person\u2019s financial behaviour (Davis & Schumm, 1987; Shih & K e, 2014). Financial attitudes shape the way people spend, save, hoard, and waste money (Furnham, 1984). Bhushan and Medury (2014) found that there is a positive correlation among financial knowledge, financial attitude and financial behaviour among salari ed individuals. Bir, (2014) found that financial management practices were significantly influenced by the positive financial attitudes, longer the job experience and stronger the family\u2019s financial background . According to study done by Mien and Thao (201 5) showed that regression estimator of relationship between financial attitude and financial behaviour was 1.106. That means a more positive in financial attitude, the more responsible in financial behaviour. Thus, the hypothesis was supported that there is a positive relationship between financial attitude and personal finance management behaviour (p -value = .000). Based on the above empirical evidence, this study develops the following hypothesis. H2: Financial attitude is significantly and positively af fect lower income peoples\u2019 personal financial management behaviour. External Locus of Control and Personal Financial Management Behaviour Locus of control represents a person's tendency as a controller or controlled by external events. Locus of control as generalized expectation about the internal versus external control of reinforcement. Locus of Control is a psychological concept about someone's beliefs about the extent to which they control events that affect them. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3863769 Sovitha andThavakumar The Journal of Business Studies 0 4(02)2020 5 Rotter divides locus of control into t wo, namely internal locus of control and external locus of control. Where people who have internal locus of control believe those skills, ability, and more effort can determine what they will get in their life. Whereas people who have more external locus o f control believe that strength from outside themselves like destiny, fate, luck and others in power who can determine their lives. Dessart and Kuylen (1986) found that people who were more external in their orientation were more likely to experience fina ncial difficulties. Perry and Morris (2005) conclude that how people feel about money depends on how they feel about their lives. In their study, Perry and Morris (2005) hypothesized that there is a negative relationship between external locus of control a nd responsible financial management behaviour. According to study done by Mien and Thao (2015), locus of control plays an important role in determining financial management behaviour among people. Further, result of his hypothesis indicated that external l ocus of control had negative effect on financial management behaviour. Based on the empirical evidence, this study develops following hypothesis. H3: External locus of control is significantly and negatively affect lower income peoples\u2019 personal financial management behaviour. 3. Conceptual Framework Independent Variable Dependent Variable . (Source: Mien & Thao, 2015 ) Figure 1: conceptual framework This research study aims to identify the factors affecting on the personal financial management behaviour of lower income people. According to the figure researcher identified Personnel financial management behaviour as the dependent variable and financial attitude, financial knowledge and external locus of control as the independent variables. In order to me asure the Personal financial management behaviour this study used following factors such as cash management, credit management, saving and investment. 4.

        "content": "Conclusion The objective one determines the level of lower income peoples\u2019 personal financial management behaviour and level of financial knowledge, financial attitude and external locus of control. Based on the output of analysis, researcher can conclude, as there i s a low level of financial knowledge and financial attitude, high level of external locus of control. On the other hand, among 360 respondents, 273 of lower income people have low level of personal financial management behaviour. Therefore, researcher can conclude that there is a low level of personal financial management behaviour among lower income people in Manmunai North Division of Batticaloa. The objective two determine the affect of financial knowledge, financial attitude and external locus of contro l on lower income peoples\u2019 personal financial management behaviour. According to the multiple regression analysis, financial knowledge and financial attitude are significantly and positively affect lower income peoples\u2019 personal financial management behavi our. In addition, external locus of control is significantly and negatively affect personal financial management behaviour of lower income people in Batticaloa. Limitations and Suggestions for Future Studies It must be acknowledged that there are some lim itations in the study. In this study, all the respondents were lower income people, which may pose limits on making generalizations of the findings to other groups. In addition, the study will be carried out in Manmunai North Divisional of Batticaloa, did not cover all the lower income people located in other divisions and districts. Some suggestions are, the present study analysed only three variables affect the personal financial management behaviour. In future if any study considers more variables and dimensions, the finding will be more worthwhile. The results of the study can be enhanced, while considering both the quantitative and qualitative data should be used to enhance this framework. Future research can include comparative studies among lower i ncome people and higher income people because there may be financial management behaviour different among them.

However, a recent seminal work by Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Siko- rskaya (2023) finds that retail investors contribute to 62% of the total trading volume in equity options. Financial media often reports investors lose hundreds of millions of dollars by playing equity options for speculation.1The fact that retail investors, on average, lose money indicates that their trading is likely motivated by sentiment, which are beliefs about future stock prices that are not justified by rational evaluation of available information. In line with the sentiment motivation of retail investor trading, Henderson, Pearson, and Wang (2023) construct a sentiment measure of retail investors using the issuance of retail struc- tured equity products. In this paper, we propose a novel sentiment measure constructed from equity call options and test its implication on the stock market risk premium in the U.S. market. When retail investors are over-optimistic about a stock, the buying pressure for the stock\u2019s call options increases without fundamental drives. To measure such buying pressure, we make use of the trading data from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), which allows us to identify the signs of the trading as well as the trader types. At the individual stock level, call option order imbalance (CIB) is defined as the net open buy volume (i.e., open buy minus open sell) divided by the total open trading volume. To obtain an overall sentiment measure, we take the cross-sectional average of individual stock\u2019s CIB and label the average call option order imbalance as aggregate equity call option order imbalance (ACIB). In our paper, ACIB is constructed at the daily, weekly, and monthly levels. Similarly, we construct aggregate equity put option order imbalance (APIB). Our empirical evidence shows that ACIB strongly and negatively predicts future stock 1See for example recent news by Forbes \u201cThe Put/Call Ratio Says \u2018Get In The Market Now!\u2019\u201d (2021), and news by Bloomberg \u201cMom and Pop Investors Took a Billion-Dollar Bath Trading Options During the Pandemic\u201d (2022). 1market excess returns, from days to months. For example, a one-standard-deviation increase in ACIB leads to a decrease in stock market excess returns of 0.075% next day, 0.240% next week, 0.945% next month, and 2.316% next quarter on average. Aggregate equity put option order imbalance (APIB), however, demonstrates no market return predictability at any horizon.",

        "content": "As documented by Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Sikorskaya (2023), retail investors tend to prefer call options over put options. Therefore, the non-results of put option order imbalance in our paper align with the idea of retail investor sentiment. To validate that ACIB captures sentiment from a new perspective, we conduct our pre- dictive regressions by controlling for a comprehensive set of existing sentiment measures as well as option-based predictors for market risk premium. Specifically, we include the follow- ing sentiment measures, such as BW sentiment (Baker and Wurgler (2007)), the surveyed consumer sentiment index from Michigan University, PLS sentiment (Huang, Jiang, Tu, and Zhou (2015)), manager sentiment (Jiang, Lee, Martin, and Zhou (2019)), GM sentiment (Gao and Martin (2021)), as well as SEP sentiment (Henderson, Pearson, and Wang (2023)), which captures retail sentiment using the issuance of retail structured equity products. The monthly ACIB measure has high correlations with BW sentiment (0.50) and with SEP sen- timent (0.33), indicating that ACIB likely captures investor sentiment, especially from retail traders. After controlling for these existing investor sentiment measures, we find that the negative forecasting capacity of ACIB remains significant. The coefficients of all the sen- timent variables are consistent with the conjecture that future stock market price declines when sentiment is high. Yet, the effects of alternative sentiment measures are relatively weaker than ACIB. Beyond its robustness to existing sentiment measures, the predictive power of ACIB also remains strong when accounting for market return predictors derived from the options market. Specifically, we control for order imbalance of call and put index options (i.e., ICIB and IPIB, respectively, as in Chordia, Kurov, Muravyev, and Subrahmanyam (2021)), variance risk premium (VRP, as in Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou (2009)), aggregate implied 2volatility spread (IVS, as in Han and Li (2021)), and aggregate purchase of deep-out-of-the- money SPX index put options (PNBO, as in Chen, Joslin, and Ni (2019)). Moreover, Huang, Li, and Wang (2021) construct a disagreement measure and document its predictive power in the stock market. As disagreement based on option open interest is an ingredient of the aggregate disagreement measure, we control for the predictor in Huang, Li, and Wang (2021) as well. The robustness of ACIB to other option-based variables highlights that ACIB contains underexplored yet unique information useful for the market risk premium. ACIB also effectively predicts stock market excess returns in two out-of-sample tests. First, we split our sample into two subperiods, i.e., before 2010 and after 2010 (2010 in- cluded). We estimate the effect of ACIB using the earlier sample and forecast market risk premium in the later period. We obtain economically large out-of-sample R2statistic. For example, at the monthly level, the out-of-sample R2reaches 6.114% when ACIB is used to predict the next month stock market excess returns. A mean-variance-utility investor who allocates wealth between the market portfolio and T-bill would obtain an annualized Sharpe ratio of 1.360 if she follows a monthly portfolio rebalancing strategy based on the predictive signal of ACIB. Second, we examine the validity of ACIB in forecasting international stock market returns. According to Baker, Wurgler, and Yuan (2012), a global sentiment index spreads across markets through private capital flows. If ACIB represents sentiment in the U.S., it would negatively forecast stock market returns in different financial markets as well. We collect the most representative stock market indices of fourteen financial markets from Global Financial Data (GFD). We calculate the raw returns of these indices at different hori- zons and again test the predictive power of CBOE-based ACIB in these financial markets. Consistent with a global sentiment framework, we find that ACIB negatively predicts future stock market returns in all the alternative fourteen financial markets. Similar to the findings in the U.S. stock market, CBOE-based APIB does not predict stock market returns in any of these alternative financial markets. So far, our results suggest that ACIB predicts stock market returns through a sentiment 3channel, especially through the sentiment of retail investors. Next, we present additional supporting evidence. First, we decompose option orders into three groups, according to trading size, moneyness, and time to maturity. Then we construct ACIB by taking the average of call options order imbalance among options only within each group.",

        "content": "Trading of smaller sizes is generally initiated by retail investors. We find consistent results that the ACIB of small trading size has stronger market return predictability compared with the ACIB of median or large trading size. Moreover, we find that ACIB from ATM call options has stronger market return predictability than ACIB from OTM or ITM options. It is consistent with the evidence in Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Sikorskaya (2023) that retail investors prefer trading at-the-money options. Second, we examine the trading by market makers and professional customers, who are less likely to trade because of sentiment. Consequently, we expect that the aggregate call option order imbalance (ACIB) constructed from the trading by these investors to have no predictive power on future stock market returns. This is indeed the case as we observe from the data, consistent with our sentiment explanation of ACIB forecasting market risk premium. Third, we examine the predictability of ACIB conditional on the level of sentiment. As suggested by Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2012), the sentiment effect by ACIB (i.e., the predictive power of ACIB) should be more salient when market participants are more optimistic in general. Henderson, Pearson, and Wang (2023) offer a very insightful way to measure retail investors\u2019 sentiment, i.e., from the retail structured equity products (SEP) issuance. We thus split our sample into two regimes based on the level of SEP. We find that the predictability by ACIB is much stronger and significant only when SEP is high. The SEP results further confirm that our sentiment index extracted from equity call options mostly reflects retail investors\u2019 sentiment. Lastly, we reconcile the aggregate sentiment effect with the cross-sectional informed trad- ing effect. A large body of literature documents that the cross-sectional variations in call and 4put option trading have meaningful implications for future cross-sectional stock returns (e.g., Pan and Poteshman (2006), Johnson and So (2012), Hu (2014), and Ge, Lin, and Pearson (2016)). We confirm the cross-sectional return implications in our sample using stock-level CIB and PIB. Specifically, when sorting stocks into quintiles according to CIB (PIB), we find stocks with high CIB (PIB) outperform (underperform) stocks with low CIB (PIB) in the cross section. To disentangle the opposite patterns observed between cross-sectional and time-series results for equity option trading, we further investigate the time-series return predictability of ACIB (APIB) on the portfolio return of each CIB (PIB) quintile. We find strong and consistent evidence that ACIB negatively forecasts the portfolio return of each CIB quintile at all levels, indicating a general sentiment effect across individual call options. Again, APIB fails to predict the portfolio returns of PIB quintiles at any level. The seem- ingly contradictory results from cross-sectional and time-series analyses could be reconciled by considering a common sentiment component among equity call options trading. Our paper contributes to the literature by proposing a novel sentiment measure from eq- uity options. Measuring investor sentiment is undeniably challenging.2Baker and Wurgler (2007) pioneered by constructing a stock market sentiment index. Recent literature sets to distinguish sentiment by different types of investors. Focusing on retail structured equity product (SEP) issuance, Henderson, Pearson, and Wang (2023) construct the first retail sentiment measure for reference stocks. Using 200 million pages of US local newspapers, van Binsbergen, Bryzgalova, Mukhopadhyay, and Sharma (2024) construct a 170-year-long mea- sure of economic sentiment at the country and state levels. Different from previous studies, we are motivated by Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Sikorskaya (2023) that retail investors con- tribute a significant portion to the trading of equity options, and construct a sentiment measure from the order imbalance of equity call options. Our measure can be easily con- structed using exchange-traded equity options volume and is available at a higher frequency, i.e., daily and weekly levels. 2As discussed in Baker and Wurgler (2007), \u201dThe question is no longer whether investor sentiment affects stock prices, but how to measure investor sentiment and quantify its effects.\u201d 5Moreover, our study deepens the understanding of interactions between options and stock markets.",

(2021) find that option-based risk protection strategies used by retail investors explain the positive predictability of weekly index put order flow on the International Securities Exchange (ISE) on weekly S&P 500 index returns. Han and Li (2021) document that the aggregate implied volatility spread (IVS) significantly and positively predicts future stock market returns via a common informed trading channel. We offer the first piece of evidence that the equity options market contains useful information for investor sentiment and pre- dicts aggregate stock market returns. Furthermore, the sentiment channel holds when we extend the predictability to other financial markets. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the construction of our predictors, data, and other key variables. Section 3 presents both in-sample and out- of-sample evidence on the aggregate market predictability by ACIB and APIB. Section 4 clarifies the economic channel of market predictability by ACIB. Section 5 investigates vari- ous discussions. Section 6 concludes the paper. 3See for example Easley, O\u2019Hara, and Srinivas (1998), Chan, Chung, and Fong (2002), Chakravarty, Gulen, and Mayhew (2004), Cao, Chen, and Griffin (2005), Pan and Poteshman (2006), Bali and Hovakimian (2009), Cremers and Weinbaum (2010), Xing, Zhang, and Zhao (2010), Johnson and So (2012), Grundy, Lim, and Verwijmeren (2012), An, Ang, Bali, and Cakici (2014), Hu (2014), Muravyev (2016), Ge, Lin, and Pearson (2016), and Ni, Pearson, Poteshman, and White (2021). 62 Variable Construction We measure equity option trading activities through order imbalance (IB) proposed by, for example, Hu (2014), Chen, Joslin, and Ni (2019), and Chordia et al. (2021) for several reasons. First, the signal IB is widely used in both practice and academia to measure trading activities in either option or stock markets.4Second, the calculation of IB only involves option trading activities, making it ideal to separate option trading from the underlying stock trading. Third, IB can be constructed using call or put volume separately, allowing us to identify the different trading effects from call and put options. Fourth, since the value of IB is bounded between \u22121 and +1, it does not need to deal with extreme outliers as for alternative volume ratios.5This is crucial for a time-series study because we need a stationary distribution of the predictor for regression analyses. The option order imbalance is constructed using the equity options trading volume from CBOE, which covers the largest portion of option trading activities across all exchanges in the United States.6The CBOE open-close data documents detailed volume information for option trading activities on CBOE. The trading volume is aggregated and bucketed by origins, such as public customers, professional customers, broker-dealers, and market makers. At the same time, it specifies and separates trading volume by buying/selling and opening/closing positions. The customer and professional customer volume can be further broken down into trading size buckets, including fewer than 100 contracts, 100-199 contracts, and greater than 199 contracts. The data on underlying stock prices is obtained from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). The target variable (i.e., market risk premium) is the value-weighted market excess return in logarithm (MKTRF) obtained from Kenneth French\u2019s website. 4Order imbalance is widely used in the stock literature as well, such as Chan and Fong (2000), Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam (2002), and Chordia and Subrahmanyam (2004). 5The extreme value issue for option trading is mentioned in Johnson and So (2012) and Ge, Lin, and Pearson (2016). 6We also construct our main predictors using another commonly used database, Nasdaq International Securities Exchange (ISE), and find similar and robust results of the stock return predictability. The results are shown as robustness checks in Section 4.",

Following Hu (2014), Chen, Joslin, and Ni (2019), and Chordia et al. (2021), we define the order imbalance of each individual equity option from end users on a certain day/week/month as the summation of total open buy trading volume less open sell trading volume divided by the sum of total trading volume across all moneyness and time to maturities from public customers within that period:7 CIB i,t=P s\u2208SOpen BuyCall i,s,t\u2212P s\u2208SOpen SellCall i,s,tP s\u2208SOpen BuyCall i,s,t+P s\u2208SOpen SellCall i,s,t, (1) PIB i,t=P s\u2208SOpen BuyPut i,s,t\u2212P s\u2208SOpen SellPut i,s,tP s\u2208SOpen BuyPut i,s,t+P s\u2208SOpen SellPut i,s,t, (2) where sis a certain option contract for stock ieach day across all traded equity call or put options in the CBOE database. Note that we exclude professional customers and only include public customers in Equations (1) and (2), in order to better reflect retail investors\u2019 trading activities. A positive call (put) order imbalance, namely CIB (PIB), indicates that there is more buying pressure than selling pressure from call (put) option end users. We use all feasible traded options tagged as customers with all trading sizes (i.e., small, medium, and large) to construct IB. In Section 4, we conduct a detailed decomposition of IB based on different trading sizes, moneyness, and time to maturity, and show that the predictive power of ACIB is mainly driven by public customers with small-size trading orders but not professional customers, implying that the predictive power of ACIB is more consistent with the sentiment explanation. Correspondingly, the aggregate call (put) option order imbalance, i.e., ACIB (APIB), is the market-value weighted average of individual call (put) IB at each point of time: ACIB t=NX i=1wi,tCIB i,t, APIB t=NX i=1wi,tPIB i,t, (3) 7The empirical results are robust if we use absolute delta-weighted or moneyness-weighted summation across all option contracts. 8where wi,tis the weight by market capitalization for each option\u2019s underlying stock i, which is calculated by the underlying stock price multiplying the shares outstanding obtained from CRSP. In general, one can think ACIB (APIB) as the aggregate end-user demand for equity call (put) options in the market. We then examine the predictive power of ACIB and APIB at daily, weekly, and monthly frequency. [Insert Figure 1] Figure 1 shows that both ACIB and APIB have stationary distributions over time. ACIB (APIB) hits the bottom (top) during the 2008 financial crisis but rebounds quickly after the recession. The trading activities between call and put options do not always move opposite to each other as commonly thought. In particular, investors trade more equity call options than equity put options in the recent period of Covid, consistent with Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Sikorskaya (2023) that more people joined the option market to trade equity call options for speculation. [Insert Table 1] Table 1 summarizes some important statistics of our predictors. There are, on average, 2,053 (1,718) firms with options traded to construct ACIB (APIB) at weekly frequency, consistent with Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Sikorskaya (2023) that, in general, equity call options are traded more popularly than equity put options by public customers, making call option trading a reasonable proxy for sentiment. The time-series averages for both ACIB and APIB are negative, implying that option traders are net sellers for both equity call and put options, similar to the findings by Lakonishok et al. (2007). Furthermore, ACIB is highly and positively related to most of the other sentiment indices, such as the sentiment index by Baker and Wurgler (2007) with a correlation of 0.50, the SEP sentiment index by Henderson, Pearson, and Wang (2023) with a correlation of 0.33, GM sentiment by Gao and Martin (2021) with a correlation of 0.55, manager sentiment by Jiang et al. (2019) with a 9correlation of 0.19, and the consumer sentiment index from University of Michigan with a correlation of 0.24. 3 Aggregate Equity Option Order Imbalance and Stock Market Risk Premium 3.1 In-sample Predictive Regression To test our hypothesis that ACIB captures investor sentiment, we expect that ACIB negatively forecasts future stock market excess returns.",

In our paper, Kis specified by days ( D), weeks ( W), or months ( M). We then run the predictive regressions with Kequal to 1, 2, 3, and 6 days/weeks/months. When K > 1, we correct the serial correlation and conditional heteroscedasticity using the Newey-West correction with K\u22121 lags (Newey and West (1987)). When running regressions, to make the coefficients comparable, we standardize all independent variables to have zero mean and one standard deviation. [Insert Table 2] Table 2 provides evidence that ACIB is a strong and contrarian predictor at daily, weekly, and monthly frequency. For example, a one-standard-deviation increase in daily ACIB fore- casts an average decrease in stock market returns of 0.075% next day, 0.240% next week, 8In an untabulated table, we also run an alternative predictive regression suggested by Hodrick (1992) and confirm that our results are robust to non-overlapped observations. 100.945% next month, and 2.316% next quarter, with the corresponding tstatistics of \u22123.36, \u22122.69,\u22122.89, and \u22123.63.9When running daily and weekly predictive regressions, we include (but not show in the tables) past one-period stock market returns to control for stock return autocorrelation. Regarding the empirical results, since the signs of ACIB are all negative, the results indicate ACIB captures the market sentiment effect instead of informed trading, which is supposed to be a positive relationship between buying call options and future stock market returns. Note that APIB does not help forecast stock returns at any horizon. There could be a couple of reasons why APIB does not work. First, given an unlimited payoff, the senti- ment effect is supposed to be stronger for lottery-liked call options than protection-liked put options, especially for unsophisticated option traders and speculators (Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Sikorskaya (2023)). Second, unlike optimistic investors, pessimistic traders can simply do nothing and leave the market away when they lose confidence to the stock market, thus their perceptions may not be reflected in put option trading activities. Third, trading put options is mostly related to risk management, instead of sentiment trading (Chen, Joslin, and Ni (2019) and Chordia et al. (2021)). To investigate whether ACIB captures any existing predictors in the literature, especially those predictors related to sentiment, we run multiple regressions with ACIB and a selected set of existing predictors. We first include the principal component of the 22 predictors based on Goyal and Welch (2008) from Amit Goyal\u2019s website.10Second, we collect all the alternative popular sentiment predictors documented in the literature, such as BW sentiment by Baker and Wurgler (2007), SEP sentiment by Henderson, Pearson, and Wang (2023), consumer survey sentiment from the University of Michigan, GM sentiment by Gao and 9The numbers of market return changes in Table 2 are adjusted based on different forecast horizons (0.075% =1 .659% /22, 0.240% =0 .958% /4, and 2.316%=0 .772%\u00d73), as all dependent variables in Table 2 are expressed at monthly frequency. 10We follow Rapach, Ringgenberg, and Zhou (2016) to construct the principle components from Amit Goyal\u2019s website. For concision, we only include the first principle component, though the results are robust to including all the three principle components as in Rapach, Ringgenberg, and Zhou (2016). 11Martin (2021), manager sentiment by Jiang et al. (2019), and PLS sentiment by Huang et al. (2015). We further include all other option-based predictors, such as variance risk premium (VRP) by Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou (2009), index call IB (ICIB) and index put IB (IPIB) based on Chordia et al. (2021), PNBO proposed by Chen, Joslin, and Ni (2019), aggregate implied volatility spread by Han and Li (2021).11We then run multiple regressions, including ACIB, APIB, and other control predictors: KX k=1rt+k K\u2261rt,t+K=a+bC\u00d7ACIB t+bP\u00d7APIB t+JX j=1bjXj,t+\u03f5t,t+K, (5) where Xj,tspecifies the control variable jlisted above. Similarly, we run the predictive regressions at daily, weekly, and monthly frequency.

For example, consistent with Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou (2009), VRP is a strong predictor at monthly and quarterly frequency. PNBO proposed by Chen, Joslin, and Ni (2019) significantly and negatively forecasts future stock market returns. The index put option order imbalance (IPIB) proposed by Chordia et al. (2021) positively forecasts stock market returns at weekly frequency, while the index call option order imbalance (ICIB) does not forecast stock market returns at any horizons. More importantly, Table 3 demonstrates that ACIB is a strong and new predictor that is different from other existing predictors. The forecasting capacity of ACIB holds strongly in short horizons such as daily and weekly, and also in the long run. ACIB is largely different from those option-based predictors with the magnitude of correlations less than 0.15. The regression results also demonstrate that 11We are grateful for Neil Pearson to provide us the aggregate SEP sentiment data. All the other predictors are either constructed by ourselves or collected from the corresponding authors\u2019 websites. 12the predictive power of ACIB is not driven by any existing stock return predictors in the literature. Consistent with our previous findings, APIB is not a useful signal for future stock market returns at any horizons. 3.2 Out-of-sample Predictive Regression In addition to in-sample evidence, we also conduct out-of-sample regressions. The statis- tical test of equal predictive accuracy in nested models is based on Clark and West (2007). The regression details are given by: \uf8f1 \uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2 \uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3rt,t+k=\u03b1+\u03b2\u00d7xt+\u03f5t,t+K, t= 1, . . . , T 0\u2212K, \u02c6rt,t+k= \u02c6\u03b1+\u02c6\u03b2\u00d7xt, t =T0, . . . , T,(6) Benchmark :rB t,t+k=1 t\u2212Kt\u2212KX s=1rs,s+K, t=T0, . . . , T, (7) where Kis the forecast horizon, rt,t+kis the market excess return from time ttot+K,xt is the value of the predictor at time t, and \u02c6 rt,t+kis the forecasted return based on xtfrom the recursive regression.

Time-series predictability of stock market returns has important implications for market timing by guiding investors to optimally allocate wealth between stock investments and a risk-free asset. Following Kandel and Stambaugh (1996) and Rapach, Strauss, and Zhou (2010), we consider a mean-variance-utility investor who allocates wealth between the market portfolio and T-bill. Given an investment horizon of Kperiods, her optimal weight on the 13market portfolio is: wt,t+K=1 \u03b3\u02c6rt,t+k \u02c6\u03c32 t,t+k, (9) where \u02c6 rt,t+kis conditional expected market excess return (i.e., forecast based on a predictor) given by ACIB or APIB. The \u02c6 \u03c32 t,t+kis estimated using the variance of the past one-year historical returns for daily and weekly frequency and five-year historical returns for monthly frequency, and the relative risk aversion \u03b3is set to be 3. The portfolio is rebalanced every day, week, or month. The corresponding Sharpe ratio of the investor\u2019s optimal portfolio is given by: SR=Rp \u03c3p, (10) where Rpand\u03c3pare the mean and the standard deviation of the portfolio return. The average utility gain or the certainty equivalent return (CER) is computed as: CER =Rp\u22120.5\u03b3\u03c32 p. (11) To gauge the economic benefit of a predictor to the mean-variance investor, we compare theCER above associated with the optimal portfolio based on the forecasts provided by the predictor to CER , the certainty equivalent return of a benchmark portfolio formed based on the average return and standard deviation estimated from historical returns. The difference is defined as the CER gain: CER Gain =CER\u2212CER. (12) [Insert Table 4] Both Panel A and Panel B in Table 4 demonstrate that ACIB has strong and significant out-of-sample predictive power to future stock market returns. For the out-of-sample R2 compared with the historical average estimation as the benchmark, ACIB achieves 2.23%, 140.76%, and 6.11% for one-day, one-week, and one-month forecast horizons.",

From a utility-gain perspective, ACIB is able to help investors achieve CER gains with 0.372% for one day, 1.385% for one week, and 10.416% for one month.12All in all, we show that investors can significantly benefit from using our variable ACIB to adjust positions of risky assets over time. 3.3 International Stock Market Return Predictability by ACIB We also examine whether ACIB can forecast international stock market returns. Baker, Wurgler, and Yuan (2012) document that there exists a global sentiment index that can spread across markets through private capital flows and functions as a contrarian predictor of country-level returns. Given that ACIB represents an option-based sentiment measure and is closely linked to stock market sentiment, it could also help identify such a global sentiment index and forecast other countries\u2019 stock market returns. We then test our hypothesis by using ACIB and APIB to forecast various countries\u2019 stock market returns through the same framework in Section 3.1. The data of country-level stock market indices is collected from Global Financial Data (GFD). For each country, we select one of the most representative stock market indices in the country denominated by local currency. We then calculate their daily, weekly, and monthly raw returns as dependent variables. Our country sample covers almost all the developed markets and some crucial emerging markets, including Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The predictive regression is the same as specified 12Note that the out-of-sample R2for longer time horizons such as M=2 and 3 may be subject to small- sample biases, as there are only 132 out-of-sample observations from 2010 to 2020. 15in Section 3.1. When running regressions, we control for the contemporaneous local stock market returns and the U.S. stock market returns suggested by Rapach, Strauss, and Zhou (2013). [Insert Table 5] Table 5 shows consistent evidence that ACIB is not only related to future U.S. stock market returns but can also forecast international stock market returns, at least among fourteen major economies. The significance cannot be explained by the local stock market momentum or the role of the U.S. stock market returns as documented in Rapach, Strauss, and Zhou (2013). All the coefficients of ACIB are negative, indicating a strong sentiment effect identified by call option trading activities. Moreover, consistent with the U.S. market, APIB does not have forecasting capacity for any of them. Our paper thus provides novel evidence that the equity call option trading activities in the U.S. market contain information for international stock markets in time series. The evidence supports a global sentiment effect as documented by Baker, Wurgler, and Yuan (2012) and further suggests that ACIB can be used as an index to measure global sentiment. 4 ACIB as a Proxy for Investor Sentiment 4.1 Decomposition of Equity Option Trading Activities So far we have provided sufficient empirical evidence to show that ACIB is a strong sentiment signal to future stock market returns. In this subsection, we provide further evidence that ACIB can be a proxy for investor sentiment, especially for retail investors, by separating equity option trading activities based on their trading size, option moneyness, and option time to maturity. We use the order size labels from CBOE to group equity options by trading size, which divides all option trades into three categories: small trade (trade volume less than 100 contracts each), medium trade (trade volume between 100 and 199), and large 16trade (trade volume greater than 199). When constructing ACIB, we separate the sample by the trading size specified by CBOE and take a market-value weighted average among stocks with all corresponding equity options in each group. With respect to option moneyness, which is defined as an option\u2019s strike price over its underlying stock\u2019s spot price, we separate options into out-of-the-money (OTM), at- the-money (ATM), and in-the-money (ITM).",

        "content": "OTM options are classified as moneyness less (greater) than 0.9 (1.1) for put (call) options, ITM options are options with moneyness greater (less) than 1.1 (0.9) for put (call) options, and ATM options are options for the rest cases. As to option time to maturity, we separate option trading into three groups: short, middle, and long horizons. The short horizon group is defined as options traded less than 15 days to maturity, the middle horizon group includes options traded between 15 and 60 days to maturity, and the long horizon group covers options traded greater than 60 days to maturity. Note that each time when constructing sub-group ACIB or APIB, we classify options by only one feature (i.e., trading size, moneyness, or time to maturity), in order to concentrate on one-dimension analysis for its effect on stock market predictability. [Insert Table 6] Table 6 Panel A demonstrates that the predictive power of ACIB mainly comes from the small trading size of equity call options. The forecasting capacity reduces significantly from small size to medium size, and totally disappears for large size. Given that trading size is widely used to identify retail and professional investors (Hvidkjaer (2008) and Barber, Odean, and Zhu (2008)), the main predictive power of ACIB coming from small trading size is consistent with the sentiment explanation that retail investors are more likely affected by market sentiment.13 In addition to this, Table 6 Panel B also shows that among options with different mon- 13As stated by Ge, Lin, and Pearson (2016), professional investors are likely to slice the trading but less subject to sentiment effect. Thus trading size is only an indicative way to identify trading by retail investors. We will conduct further tests to identify retail trading. 17eyness, ACIB constructed using ATM options has the best performance across different moneyness, further consistent with our sentiment explanation as Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Sikorskaya (2023) find that retail traders prefer trading at-the-money options. The next well-performed type of options is ITM ACIB, while the worst performed ACIB is constructed using OTM options. Using O/S ratio, Ge, Lin, and Pearson (2016) find that informed trad- ing of equity options mainly concentrates among OTM call options. Thus our finding is more consistent with sentiment trading instead of informed trading. It is worth noting that APIB does not help to forecast stock market returns among any option groups, implying that eq- uity put option trading is less likely driven by sentiment motivation. Note that from Table 6 Panel C, the factor of time to maturity does not affect the predictive power of ACIB, although options with middle and long horizon time to maturity have relatively stronger predictive power. In summary, by computing ACIB and APIB based on various groups, we provide further supporting evidence that the predictive power of ACIB mainly comes from investor sentiment, especially from retail investors. 4.2 Different Types and Exchanges of Equity Option Traders Another classification to group options is based on different types of traders. The CBOE database has detailed documents regarding the types of traders who submit the correspond- ing trading orders. In particular, CBOE classifies option traders mainly into three types: market makers, customers, and professional customers. Market makers include those option accounts for brokers or dealers which are either options clearing corporation (OCC) mem- bers or any affiliations for clearing purposes.14Customers are trading accounts for public investors, which are the main trading activities we used to construct ACIB in our paper. Professional customers are trading accounts classified as professional investors by broker- age firms. Taking advantage of this classification, we construct IB based on customers, 14There are three types of accounts affiliated with market makers in the CBOE database: firm, broker- dealer, and market maker. When constructing ACIB for market makers, we combine the trading records for all three types of accounts. 18professional customers, and market makers, and use them to forecast stock market returns separately. If the forecasting capacity of ACIB is mainly driven by the sentiment effect, we expect to observe a stronger predictive power from public customers but not from professional customers or market makers.",

        "content": "While we only use option trading data of new opening positions to construct ACIB, the closing position of option orders may also provide useful information to forecast aggregate stock returns. As an alternative, we use closing trading option data from CBOE to construct ACIB and APIB. The empirical results are available in Table 7 Panel C. In addition to this, since our data only covers option trading activities on CBOE, our results may be sensitive to exchange and data-specific issues. To reconcile this concern, we re-compute ACIB and APIB using the alternative database from Nasdaq International Securities Exchange (ISE), which is widely used in many other papers in the literature such as Ge, Lin, and Pearson (2016), Chordia et al. (2021), and Ni et al. (2021). The results are provided in Table 7 Panel D. [Insert Table 7] Table 7 displays the predictive power of ACIB and APIB based on the order flows exe- cuted by different types of traders and alternative data sources. The results are consistent with our conclusion that the predictive power of ACIB is mainly driven by retail investors\u2019 trading activities. If we construct ACIB (APIB) using professional customers\u2019 order flows, we do not see any predictive power of ACIB (APIB). The similar evidence is found for order flows from market makers. Note that ATM ACIB from market makers has positive signs to forecast stock market returns, which is mechanically driven by taking counter-party positions of public customers, therefore still reflecting sentiment effect instead of informed trading. Table 7 Panel C shows that the closing position trading activities have some predictive power, although the results are not as strong as opening positions.15As discussed in Pan and 15Note that the positive signs of ACIB from the closing positions of option orders do not contradict our 19Poteshman (2006) and Ge, Lin, and Pearson (2016), the closing position trading activities mainly involve the closing of previously established long positions; thus they could be less informative to the current market status, either fundamentals or sentiment. Similarly, Table 7 Panel D demonstrates that our finding is not driven by exchange specification, as we obtain similar stock market return predictability using the ISE database. The correlation between the alternative ACIB constructed from ISE and ACIB based on CBOE is as high as 0.78, suggesting a market-wide sentiment effect across option exchanges. Given both ISE and CBOE cover a significant proportion of total option trading activities, the results are largely consistent with each other. In summary, as falsification tests, we demonstrate in this subsection that the predictive power of ACIB is more likely driven by sentiment trading and is persistent across different option exchanges. 4.3 Option to Stock Volume (O/S) Ratio In Section 2, we discussed the motivations and reasons why we choose IB as the main predictor. Another popular variable of option trading volume is O/S ratio used by Roll, Schwartz, and Subrahmanyam (2010), Johnson and So (2012), and Ge, Lin, and Pearson (2016). In this subsection, we conduct further tests to justify equity call option trading as a proxy for sentiment using the alternative variable O/S ratio to measure option trading activities. One advantage of using O/S ratio is that it can separate the effect between buy and sell trading activities, so that we can examine further the source of the predictive power of distinct option trading activities. We calculate the ratio of option trading volume to stock trading volume and aggregate it to the market level by taking the cross-sectional market-value weighted average. Following Ge, Lin, and Pearson (2016), we decompose the numerator of the O/S ratio into distinct option trading activities, including call option opening buy position (COB), main findings, because closing buy activities defined by CBOE are equivalent to selling owned call options to close the existing positions (https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-to-open-vs.-buy-to-close:-investment- guide). 20call option opening sell position (COS), put option opening buy position (POB), and put option opening sell position (POS). All the denominators remain as the total stock trading volume at a certain point of time. We first take the ratio of the decomposed option trading to stock trading (O/S ratio) at the individual stock level, and then aggregate to the market level by taking a market-value weighted average.",

[Insert Table 8] The conclusion is consistent that only those variables related to call option trading are able to forecast market risk premium, although none of them can beat the performance of ACIB.16Put option trading still does not provide any useful information of future stock market returns. A new finding based on O/S ratio is that net buying call options are more informative to future stock returns than net selling call options. Among all different predictive regressions separated by option moneyness, the magnitude of tstatistics for net buying call options (i.e., ACOB/S) is larger and more stable than net selling call options (i.e., ACOS/S). Buying call options can be more easily driven by sentiment (e.g., optimistic mood) while selling call options is linked to other trading purposes such as writing call options to collect premiums (e.g., covered call strategy) and hedging an existing long position. Therefore, the O/S ratio tests further support our argument of sentiment trading among equity call options. 4.4 The Predictive Power of ACIB in Different Regimes Many previous studies show that the sentiment effect is more significant when the market participants are more optimistic in general. Motivated by this, we conduct empirical tests by 16Unlike aggregate IB, aggregate O/S ratio is subject to extreme-value issues. Even though we exclude observations beyond 99% and 1% of all the observations in the cross section, the aggregate O/S ratio is still very sensitive to extreme values, as individual O/S ratios are not bounded. 21separating the sample period into two regimes based on high and low sentiment, namely below and above average (i.e., the median of time-series sentiment level). Henderson, Pearson, and Wang (2023) use retail structured equity product (SEP) issuances to construct a new sentiment measure and also an aggregate sentiment index for the stock market. To identify the high and low sentiment status (particularly related to option investors\u2019 sentiment), we use the SEP sentiment index to identify the different regimes. If ACIB reflects sentiment, we should observe stronger return predictability in the high regime of the SEP sentiment level (i.e., retail investors are more optimistic) and no return predictability in the low regime. Table 9 Panel A confirms this finding that stock market returns appear predictable by ACIB only when the level of SEP sentiment is above the median. [Insert Table 9] Second, most equity option traders have an incentive to bet against firms\u2019 earnings an- nouncements. Therefore, the sentiment trading of equity options should be more salient around firms\u2019 earnings seasons. Motivated by this, we construct an indicator to identify the time period when more companies announce their quarterly earnings. In particular, we collect the earnings announcement data from Compustat and identify each firm\u2019s quarterly earnings announcement date. On a certain day, we calculate the proportion of firms with earnings announcements out of the total public firms in the United States. The time-series proportions of firms with earnings announcements displayed in Figure 2 are then used as a proxy for the intensity of sentiment trading by option traders on that day. Lastly, we sepa- rate the sample days from 2005 to 2020 into two regimes: above and below the median of the level of the time-series proportion of earnings announcement.17The high regime indicates that equity options trading is more likely driven by sentiment. Therefore, within the regime of more firms\u2019 earnings announcements, we should observe the stronger predictive power of ACIB. Our regression results in Table 9 Panel B confirm this hypothesis. 17We use the median of the time series as the cut-off point in order to make the data observations equally separated into each regime. 22[Insert Figure 2] Since we aim at forecasting aggregate stock returns of the whole stock market, options trading coverage on the underlying stocks can also play an important role in determining the predictive power of ACIB. When options trading coverage is lower, namely fewer stocks with available options trading, ACIB will not be able to stand for the whole market status, therefore not functioning well as a sentiment indicator.",

        "content": "Motivated by this, we construct a time-series variable as a proxy for option trading coverage, which is defined as the total number of stocks with available call option trading activities divided by the total number of stocks traded on exchanges in the United States. The time-series option trading coverage is displayed in Figure 2. One can see that equity option trading accounts for a relatively small portion of all available traded stocks. The average coverage ratio of option trading to stock trading is about 30%. However, the ratio significantly increases to more than 80% on average if we only look at the stocks belonging to the S&P 500 index members. Since the stock market returns in the U.S. are mainly driven by large-cap stocks, it is reasonable that ACIB can forecast the whole stock market returns, even if the total number of stocks with options trading only accounts for a small portion among all available traded stocks. Similarly, we separate the time-series sample from 2005 to 2020 into two regimes: above and below the median of the level of option trading coverage. We then run daily, weekly, and monthly predictive regressions of stock market returns on ACIB and APIB within each regime. Table 9 Panel C shows a persistent pattern that the predictive power of ACIB is only significant when the options trading coverage is higher than the median level, while it totally loses significance when the options trading coverage is lower than the median. The effect of option trading coverage on predictive power of ACIB also demonstrates that it is less likely driven by some common systematic risks among equity option trading activities. Our results in Table 9 thus demonstrate that the predictive power of ACIB is more related to sentiment effect instead of risk premium or informed trading, which is not supposed to have such a predictive pattern. 235 Discussion 5.1 Different Patterns between Cross-sectional and Time-series Analyses One may argue that our finding contradicts some previous studies such as Pan and Poteshman (2006), Johnson and So (2012), Hu (2014), and Ge, Lin, and Pearson (2016) that options trading volume conveys informed trading in the equity options market. In this subsection, we demonstrate that our results do not contradict but complement the previous findings that option trading activities not only convey informed trading but also reflect sentiment. We first investigate the cross-sectional pattern of CIB (PIB) forecasting stock returns. Following Pan and Poteshman (2006) and Ge, Lin, and Pearson (2016), we focus on weekly return prediction. By the end of each week (i.e., Friday), we sort all stocks into quintiles based on either CIB or PIB. Within each quintile, we form a portfolio with equal-weighted stock positions, and hold for one, two, or three weeks. We compute the average stock returns over the corresponding non-overlapped holding period for each portfolio. Table 10 Panel A displays the investment performance for stock portfolio returns sorted by either CIB or PIB as well as the difference in returns between the top and bottom quintiles, namely the long- short portfolios. For W > 1 in Table 10 Panel A, the weekly portfolio returns are computed using the return of the corresponding weeks without overlaps. We also provide portfolio returns for the contemporaneous week (i.e., W= 0) when the portfolios are formed based on CIB or PIB. [Insert Table 10] Consistent with the informed trading mechanism documented in cross-sectional option studies, we find that IB is a strong cross-sectional predictor among individual stocks. A higher CIB (PIB), on average, forecasts a relatively higher (lower) future stock return, in- 24dicating informed trading among equity options. The long-short portfolio returns remain significant for up to two weeks. Pan and Poteshman (2006) document that the put-to-call volume ratio can negatively forecast stock returns the next day and week. Similarly, Ge, Lin, and Pearson (2016) decompose the O/S ratio and find that the predictive power of O/S ratio in cross-section mainly comes from buying and selling call options by informed traders. To the best of our knowledge, however, there are no papers documenting either call IB or put IB can forecast stock returns in cross section separately.",

        "content": "Our empirical tests thus make a new contribution to the cross-sectional studies of the option literature as well. So why do we observe the opposite pattern between cross-sectional (CS) and time-series (TS) results for equity option trading? Note that in Table 10 Panel A, although high CIBs generate higher stock returns in the next period cross-sectionally, the pattern is not the same if we look at it from a time-series perspective. Comparing the portfolio performance from W= 0 to W= 1, except for the portfolio with the highest CIB (i.e., Port 5), the rest portfolios show significant drop-offs of stock returns. In particular, the average returns of portfolio 1 to 4 drop from 0.362%, 0.616%, 0.600%, 0.471% at W= 0, to 0.190%, 0.220%, 0.234%, 0.293% at W= 1. In other words, while we observe high CIB portfolios outperform low CIB portfolios in the cross section, most CIB portfolio returns consistently show a return reversal pattern in the next period, indicating overbought or oversold activities of equity option trading at W= 0. [Insert Figure 3] Figure 3 illustrates the pattern described above. Following this logic, we might be able to explain the opposite pattern between the cross-sectional (CS) and time-series (TS) predictive power of CIB. The main reason comes from the different empirical designs between CS and TS analyses. The target for the CS test focuses on a long-short portfolio sorted by CIB, which computes the difference in future stock returns between the top portfolio and the 25bottom portfolio: Long\u2212Short Return =1 MMX i\u2208Port 5Ri,t\u22121 MMX j\u2208Port 1Rj,t. (13) The high minus low portfolio (i.e., positive news minus negative news, namely \u201dPort 5-1\u201d in Table 10) will largely keep the informed trading information in the cross section, although the sentiment effect will be offset, as it has the same sign for different levels of CIB. As a result, the stock return predictability by CIB will be more related to informed trading. On the other hand, when CIBs are aggregated to the market level, known as ACIB, the positive and negative news of individual firms largely cancel each other out. As a result, stock market returns are primarily influenced by systematic information such as sentiment. Specifically, since the sentiment effect has a consistent direction across different levels of CIB portfolios, sentiment information persists at the market level and, consequently, in ACIB. This leads to a negative relationship between ACIB and future stock market returns over time. In summary, our hypothesis predicts two main outcomes: first, ACIB not only negatively forecasts stock market returns but also negatively forecasts other portfolio-level stock returns that are influenced by market sentiment. Second, ACIB is not expected to predict the returns of CIB-sorted long-short portfolios, which are dominated by informed trading. To test our hypothesis, we run predictive regressions of the portfolio returns sorted by CIB (PIB) on ACIB (APIB) at daily, weekly, and monthly frequency, and see whether there is a persistent sentiment pattern by ACIB across different portfolios. The results are provided in Table 10 Panel B. In the last row of Table 10 Panel B, we also run regressions of the long-short portfolio returns (i.e., \u201dPort 5-1\u201d) sorted by CIB (PIB) on ACIB (APIB). The regression results are consistent with our predictions that although higher CIBs lead to higher stock returns in the cross section, all the CIB portfolios show a strong return reversal pattern in time series, as their returns can be negatively predicted by ACIB, indicating 26a general sentiment effect across individual call options. On the contrary, ACIB has no predictive power on the long-short portfolio spread (i.e., \u201dPort 5-1\u201d in Table 10 Panel B), which can be treated as a proxy for portfolio returns dominated by informed trading. It is worth noting that although PIB has predictive power in the cross section, APIB does not forecast either stock market returns or portfolio-level stock returns in time series. The finding is consistent with our explanation based on Figure 3 and Table 10 Panel A that the sentiment effect of PIB does not have the same sign across different levels of PIB.",

Therefore, when PIBs are aggregated across portfolios, there is no consistent sentiment effect reserved like ACIB. In summary, we argue the reason why TS and CS analyses generate different outcomes of CIB forecasting stock returns is because the CS analysis (i.e. the high-minus-low portfolio spread) reflects informed trading across equity options while the TS analysis (i.e., ACIB) echoes investor sentiment. Our time-series results do not reject the conclusion of informed trading that has been widely documented in the option literature, but highlight the different information sets among equity options trading activities. 5.2 Stock Market Return Predictability by Index Options So far, we focus on equity option trading activities. In this subsection, we conduct a similar analysis for index option trading activities. Compared with equity options trading, index options trading is well-studied in the literature. For example, Chen, Joslin, and Ni (2019) use deep out-of-the-money index put options to construct an order imbalance variable PNBO and find it negatively forecasts stock market returns. Similarly, Chordia et al. (2021) conduct a detailed analysis on stock market return predictability using index options. They examine both index put and index call option IB to forecast stock market returns and 27find that only index put IB has predictive power for S&P 500 index returns at the weekly frequency. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no papers documenting index call option trading activities forecasting stock market returns. In this subsection, we conduct a comprehensive study across all available index options in our database. Besides those index options used by Chen, Joslin, and Ni (2019) and Chordia et al. (2021), we choose seven index options in the CBOE database with enough trading observations. They are Russell 2000 index option (RUT), Dow Jones Industrial Average index option (DJX), Nasdaq 100 index option (NDX), CBOE Mini-NDX index option (MNX), S&P 500 index option (SPX), S&P 100 index option (OEX), and CBOE VIX option (VIX). For each index option, we construct the corresponding index IB for call and put options, namely ICIB and IPIB. To examine the predictive power of index options in detail, following our previous settings, we further group index options by three categories of option moneyness: ITM (moneyness greater than 1.1 for put and less than 0.9 for call), OTM (moneyness less than 0.9 for put and greater than 1.1 for call), and ATM (otherwise). Within each group of moneyness, we compute the IB for index call and put options separately. We then run predictive regressions of stock market excess returns (MKTRF) on various index call and put IBs. The results are provided in Table 11. [Insert Table 11] The general conclusion is that the predictive power of index IB is sensitive to option moneyness and also index types. For example, consistent with Chordia et al. (2021), we find that the IPIBs of RUT and DJX from index put options have significant predictive power to MKTRF at the weekly frequency, although the forecasting capacity concentrates on ATM options. Similar to Chordia et al. (2021), the ICIBs of RUT and DJX from index call options do not help forecast stock returns at any horizon. However, the results are different for OEX options. The ICIBs of OEX from both OTM and ATM index call options have significant and negative predictive power, whereas the IPIBs of OEX from index put options show 28no forecasting capacity at any horizon. More importantly, among all index call options, no matter significant or insignificant, ICIB shows a consistently negative correlation with future stock market returns, suggesting sentiment trading. In an untabulated table, we run multiple predictive regressions by including both index IB and aggregate equity option IB as predictors for each index option. We find that the predictive power of ACIB survives in all cases, implying that our findings cannot be ex- plained by index option trading activities. More importantly, we link our finding of ACIB to market sentiment effect, which is not documented by index option trading in the literature.",

More specifically, we study whether ACIB and APIB can forecast either future stock market volatility or future aggregate firm-level volatility in time series. The stock market volatility is computed as the standard deviation of the past 22 daily stock market excess returns (MKTRF). As to the aggregate firm-level volatility, we first compute a daily standard deviation of stock returns using a 22-day rolling window for each firm, and then take the cross-sectional market-value weighted average to obtain an aggregate firm-level volatility measure as in Goyal and Santa-Clara (2003) and Han and Li (2023). We then run a similar predictive regression as in Section 3.1: KX k=1\u03c3t+k K\u2261\u03c3t,t+K=a+b\u00d7Xt+\u03f5t,t+K, (14) 29where \u03c3t+kis either the stock market volatility or the value-weighted firm-level volatility at time t+k;Xtis the predictor variable of interest (either ACIB or APIB); Kstands for the forecast horizon, specified by days ( D), weeks ( W), and months ( M). We then run the predictive regressions with Kequal to 1, 2, and 3 days/weeks/months. When K > 1, we correct the serial correlation and conditional heteroscedasticity using the Newey- West correction with K\u22121 lags (Newey and West (1987)). When running regressions, all independent variables are scaled to have zero mean and one standard deviation. Volatility is well known to be forecastable, as it is quite persistent over time. In order to demonstrate the incremental volatility information contained in equity options trading, when running the predictive regression, we control for various existing volatility predictors documented in the literature. In particular, we control for the contemporaneous market return in the regression for leverage effect (Black (1976)), VIX, long-memory volatility per- sistence (Corsi (2009)), and index option IB. For the long-memory volatility persistence, we follow Corsi (2009) and construct the Heterogeneous Autoregressions (HAR) model with 1, 5, 10, and 20-day moving-average volatility. The HAR model has been demonstrated to have superior performance in capturing conditional volatility dynamics.18The regression results are presented in Table 12. [Insert Table 12] One can clearly see that although APIB does not forecast stock market returns, it has significant incremental explanatory power on both future stock market volatility and future aggregate firm-level volatility up to two weeks. A higher APIB is always followed by higher future stock market volatility, indicating equity put option trading is more likely related to hedging demand and volatility trading. The significance is considerable and robust after controlling for existing volatility predictors. On the contrary, ACIB does not show any forecasting capacity on stock volatility this time. Our empirical result thus indicates a 18For example, Andersen and Bollerslev (1998) and Corsi (2009) demonstrate that the HAR model provides higher R2than the GARCH model. 30significant difference in trading motivations between equity call and equity put options. 6 Conclusion Previous studies find equity option trading activities are related to informed trading of their underlying stocks. Applying a time-series analysis, we show that equity options trading in the aggregate is also related to investors\u2019 sentiment, especially by retail options traders. We find that aggregate equity call option order imbalance (ACIB), defined as the cross- sectional average order imbalance of equity call options, predicts significantly and negatively future stock market returns. Its predictive power cannot be explained by existing return predictors and is significant both in-sample and out-of-sample. Our findings are consistent with many recent studies on retail option trading activities (e.g., Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Sikorskaya (2023) and Henderson, Pearson, and Wang (2023)) and further show their impact on market risk premium. We find ACIB is closely related to investor sentiment. Further evidence demonstrates that the predictive power of ACIB is mainly driven by the sentiment effect that option traders overbuy options, therefore functioning as contrarian signals to future stock market returns.",

The forecast target is the market excess returns (MKTRF) at daily (D), weekly (W), and monthly frequency (M). The out-of-sample R2statistic and the certainty equivalent return (CER) are specified in Section 3. The z-stat is computed based on Clark and West (2007). We reject the null hypothesis if the z-stat is greater than 1.282 (for a one-sided test at 10% confidence), 1.645 (for a one-sided test at 5% confidence), or 2.334 (for a one-sided test at 1% confidence).

Each column in this table corresponds to one multiple predictive regression for one country\u2019s stock market returns, labeled by the forecast horizons (D=day, W=week, and M=month) in Panel A, B, and C. The definition of all the predictors can be found in Section 3.1. The dependent variable is the average daily/weekly/monthly stock market returns in each country specified at the top of the columns of each panel, over the relevant forecast horizon, and all predictors are normalized to have zero mean and one standard deviation. All dependent variables are expressed at monthly frequency. Within all regressions, we include other control variables, which are not listed in the table, including the local country\u2019s stock market returns and the US stock market returns. \u201cb\u201d is the slope coefficient on the predictor and expressed as a percentage of the raw value (multiplied by 100).

Within each type, we aggregate all available option IBs using a market value-weighted scheme. In Panel B, we group the data by moneyness, defined as the strike over spot price. Out-of-the money (OTM) options are classified as moneyness less (greater) than 0.9 for put (call) options, in-the-money (ITM) options are classified as moneyness greater (less) than 1.1 for put (call), and at-the-money (ATM) options for the rest cases. In Panel C, we repeat a similar process but separate the data by time to maturity. The short horizon group includes options less than 15 days to maturity, the middle horizon group covers options between 15 and 60 days to maturity, and the long horizon group contains options greater than 60 days to maturity. The different types of ACIB and APIB are used to forecast market excess returns at the daily frequency (D). The t-stat is computed using the GMM standard errors with D\u22121 Newey-West lag correction. The sample period is from 2005 to 2020. Panel A.

In Panel B, we repeat a similar process but use professional customers\u2019 trading volume marked by CBOE.

In Panel D, we use option data from the Nasdaq International Securities Exchange (ISE) to construct ACIB and APIB. The results are displayed by grouping options into different moneyness. Out-of-the-money (OTM) options are classified as moneyness less (greater) than 0.9 for puts (calls), in-the-money (ITM) options are options with moneyness greater (less) than 1.1 for puts (calls), and at-the-money (ATM) options for the rest classifications.

The four different components are aggregate call opening buy volume to stock volume (ACOB/S), aggregate call opening sell volume to stock volume (ACOS/S), aggregate put opening buy volume to stock volume (APOB/S), and aggregate put opening sell volume to stock volume (APOS/S). We then run multiple predictive regressions for the O/S ratios within each group at the daily frequency. The dependent variable is the excess daily (D) returns in the logarithm of the value-weighted market portfolio (MKTRF) over the relevant forecast horizons. All dependent variables are expressed at monthly frequency. The results are displayed by grouping options into different moneyness. The t-stat is computed using the GMM standard errors with D\u22121 Newey-West lag correction. The sample period is from 2005 to 2020.",

We run daily, weekly, and monthly predictive regressions of stock market excess returns (MKTRF) on ACIB and APIB within each regime. We conduct a similar test in Panel B, except that the separation is based on the proportion of firms with earnings announcements out of total public firms over time. A higher proportion indicates higher sentiment periods over time. In Panel C, we use the option trading coverage, which is defined as the number of stocks with call option trading divided by the number of available trading stocks, to separate regimes of the sample. \u201c D/W/M \u201d stands for the forecast time horizon in a number of days/weeks/months. \u201cb\u201d is the slope coefficient on the predictor and is expressed as a percentage of the raw value (multiplied by 100).

We select seven index options actively traded at CBOE, which are specified in Section 5.2. We then run multiple predictive regressions for index IB at the daily frequency. The dependent variable is the excess daily (D) returns in the logarithm of the value- weighted market portfolio (MKTRF) over the relevant forecast horizon. The results are displayed by grouping options into different moneyness. Out-of-the-money (OTM) options are classified as moneyness less (greater) than 0.9 for put (call) options, in-the-money (ITM) options are classified as moneyness greater (less) than 1.1 for put (call) options, and at-the-money (ATM) options for the rest cases. \u201cb\u201d is the slope coefficient on the predictor and expressed as a percentage of the raw value (multiplied by 100). When D > 1, to adjust for the overlapping dependent variable, the t-stat is computed using the GMM standard errors with D\u22121 Newey-West lag correction. The sample period is from 2005 to 2020. \u201c \u2212\u201c indicates insufficient observations.",

Each column in this table corresponds to one multiple predictive regression, labeled by the forecast horizons (D=day, W=week, and M=month). The definition of all the predictors can be found in Section 3.1. The dependent variable is the average daily/weekly/monthly stock market volatility in Panel A and the value-weighted average of firm-level volatility in Panel B, over the relevant forecast horizon, and all predictors are normalized to have zero mean and one standard deviation. All dependent variables are expressed at monthly frequency. The \u201dOther Controls\u201d include: market excess returns (MKTRF), VIX, and the Heterogeneous Autoregressions (HAR) model with 1, 5, 10, and 20-day moving-average volatility suggested by Corsi (2009). \u201cb\u201d is the slope coefficient on the predictor and expressed as percentage of the raw value (multiplied by 100). When D/W/M > 1, the t-stat is computed using the GMM standard errors with D/W/M \u22121 Newey-West lag correction. The sample period is from 2005 to 2020.",

For example, we cannot test the cause of the Flash Crash by reproducing the event s of that date, while subtracting the trades of individual participants in order to derive a cause -effect mechanism. This elementary exercise, so common in Physics laboratories such as Berkeley Lab or CERN, is unavailable to financial researchers (L\u00f3pez de Prado [2017]) . In absence of this essential scientific tool, financial researchers often resort to conducting backtests, which are simulations of how an investment portfolio would have performed under a particular historical scenario. The performance of s uch portfolio is often measured in term s of the Sharpe ratio (SR) , which has become de facto the most popular investment performance metric. The distributional properties of the SR are well -known, allowing researchers to use this statistic to test the profitability of a strategy for a given confidence level (Lo [2002], Bailey and L\u00f3pez de Prado [2012]) . A false positive occurs when a statistical test rejects a true null hypothesis. The probability of obtaining a false positive is set by the significan ce level (usually 5%) . This false positive probability does not remain constant, and it necessarily increases as more than one test is conducted on the same data. The implication is that, applying the same rejection threshold for the null hypothesis under multiple testing will grossly underestimate the probability of obtaining a false positive . The practice of carrying out multiple tests without adjusting the rejection threshold is so widespread and misleading that the American Statistical Association consi ders it unethical (American Statistical Association [1997 ]). In particular, if we test multiple strategies on the same data, we should demand an increasing SR for the same false positive probability (Bailey et al. [2014 a], Bailey and L\u00f3pez de Prado [2014]) . Backtest overfitting occurs when a researcher makes a false discovery (finds a false positive) as a result of selecting the best outcome out of a multiplicity of backtests conducted on the same dataset. As soon as a researcher executes more than one ba cktest on a given dataset, backtest overfitting is taking place with a non -null probability. The goal of this paper is to provide a practical methodology that will allow researchers to compute and report the probability that an investment strategy is a fal se positive , while controlling for selection bias under multiple testing (SBuMT) . The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 lists the contributions made by this paper . Section 4 describes the distributional properties of the SR. Section 5 computes the probability that a strategy is a false positive in a single -test setting. Section 6 states the false strategy theorem. Section 7 explains how to compute the probability that a strategy is a false positive in a multiple -test setting.",

Section 10 summarizes our findings. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=31670174 2. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE In a series of papers, William Sharpe introduced the notion of measuring the performance of portfolio managers in terms of their risk -adjusted returns (Sharpe [1966, 1975, 1994]). This makes intuitive sense, since the portfolio tha t maximizes returns subject to a level of risk is a member of the Markowitz\u2019s efficient frontier. This performance measure quickly grew in popularity and became by far the premier statistic used to compare the performance across portfolio managers (Bailey and L\u00f3pez de Prado [2012]). Lo [2002] studie d the distributional properties o f the SR. He concluded that, u nder the assumption of independent and identically distributed ( IID) Normal returns, the SR estimator follows a Normal distribution with mean SR and a standard deviation that depends on the very value of SR and the number of observations . Mertens [2002 ] found that the Normality assumption on returns could be dropped, and still the estimated SR would follow a Normal distribution . Christie [2005 ] derive d a limiting distribution that only assumes stationary and ergodic returns, thus allowing for time -varying conditional volatilities, serial correlation and even non -IID returns. Surprisingly, Opdyke [2007 ] proved that the expressions in Mertens [2002 ] and Christie [2005 ] are in fact identical. Bailey and L\u00f3pez de Prado [2012] deri ved the probability that the true SR exceeds a given benchmark level , under non -Normal returns. Until 2014, all estimates of the SR assumed that returns were the result of a single trial. In a world where researchers routinely conduct millions of backtest s, clearly that is an unrealistic assumption. To address this problem, Bailey and L\u00f3pez de Prado [2014] introduced the deflated Sharpe ratio (DSR), which computes the probability that the true SR is positive while controlling for SBuMT . In this paper we focus on Type I errors (false positives) rather than Type II errors (false negatives), because the former are actual economic losses , whereas the latter are opportunity losses. A hedge fund manager has a vested interest in minimizing Type II errors, while he receives a free call option on Type I errors. In othe r words, investors participate i n the upside and downside, w hile managers participate only i n the upside. Therefore, investors may adopt a \u201csafety first\u201d principle and concentrate on Type I errors, kn owing that financial incentives take care of the Type II errors. For a treatment of both errors, see Harvey et al. [2018b] and L \u00f3pez de Prado and Lewis [2018] . In general terms, t he statistics literature on multiple testing works with two different definitions of Type I error: First, the Familywise Error Rate (FWER) is defined as the probability that at least one false positive takes place. FWER -based tests are designed to control for a single false positive (Holm [ 1979 ]). Second, the False Discovery Rate (FDR) is defined as the expected value of the ratio of false positives to predicted positives. FDR -based tests are designed to generate Type I errors at a constant rate, proportion al to the number of predicted positives (Benjamini and Hochberg [1995], Benjamini and Liu [1999], Benjamini and Yekutieli [2001]) . In most scientific and industrial applications, FWER is considered overly punitive, and authors prefer to use FDR . For exampl e, it would be impractical to design a car model where we control for the probability that a single unit will be defective . However, i n the context of finance, we advise against the use of FDR. The reason is, an investor does not typically allocate funds t o all strategies with predicted positives within a family of trials , where a proportion of them are likely Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=31670175 to be false. Instead, investors are only introduced to the single best strategy out of a family of millions of alternatives.",

        "content": "Following the car analogue , in finance there is actually a single car unit produced per model, which everyone will use . If the only produced unit is defective, everyone will crash . For example, investors are not exposed to the dozens of alternative model specifications trie d by Fama and French. They have only been told about the one specification that Fama and French found to be best, and they have no ability to invest in their alternative models that passed individual statistical significance tests . Hence we argue that, in the context of financial applications, the more realistic Type I error definition is to control for a single error, not for an error rate . Accordingly, t he procedure explained in this paper applies a FWER definition of Type I error. 3. OUR CONTRIBUTIONS Bailey and L\u00f3pez de Prado [2012, 2014] and Bailey et al. [2014] introduced the False Strategy theorem (see Section 6.1) , and demonstrated how a SR estimate can be used to reject false discoveries under non -Normal returns while controlling for SBuMT . Critically, th is theorem required the estimation of two meta -research variables, in the sense that they are variables related to the research process itself, rather than the outcome of the research . These two meta -research variables in question are: (1) The estimation of the number of effectively uncorrelated tests (E[\ud835\udc3e]); and (2) the variance of the SR across the K effectively uncorrelated tests (E[V[{\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc58}]]). With the help of both variables, we can discount the likelihood of \u201clucky findings\u201d , that is, random patterns that appear naturally in the data but are meaningless . In this paper we provide practical solutions to the estimation of these two critical meta -research variables . Important papers on this subject, published by Campbell Harvey and his coauthors, include Harvey et al. [2015, 2016, 2018 a]. Their work shares si milarities with ours, particularly as it relates to our concern that the practical totality of academic papers published in financial economics do not control for SBuMT , and the implication that most discoveries in empirical finance are likely to be false. Despite these similarities, our goals and mathematical approaches are different, as explained in Harvey et al. [2015, Section 3.4]. Particularly relevant is Harvey et al. [2015], which applies the \u0160id\u00e1k correction (\u0160id\u00e1k [1967] ) to estimate the probability of observing a maximal SR that exceeds a given threshold . Their key assumption s are that returns are Normally distributed, and that trials are either independent or there is a constant average correlation between trials. Our met hod is diff erent in three ways: 1. We do not assume that returns follow a Normal distribution . Empirical studies show that hedge fund returns exhibit substantial negative skewness and positive excess kurtosis. Wrongly assuming that returns are Normal underestimate s the false positive probability (see Section 5) . Our derived probability of a false discovery incorporates information regarding the trials\u2019 sample length, and the skewness and kurtosis of the observed returns. 2. Our method is based on Extreme Value Theory, rather than \u0160id\u00e1k\u2019s correction . We derive the probability of a false positive adjusted for SBuMT through the direct application of the False Strategy theorem (see Section 6 herein ). Notably, the False Strategy theorem uses the variance of the trials\u2019 SRs to accurately estimate the threshold Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=31670176 that the maximal SR must exceed to be statistically significant (see Section 6.2) . Incorporating this variance information is critical when returns are not drawn from an IID Normal distribution (see Section 4) . 3. We do not assume a constant average correlation across trials . A family of backtests often contains heterogen eous strategies. Trials that belong to the same strategy tend to be highly correlated among themselves, while trials that belong to different strategies tend to exhibit a lower correlation. This clustering of trials around heterogeneous strategies leads to a hierarchical structure, which can be highly irregula r and complex.",

        "content": "Assuming a constant correlation across all trials fails to recognize that hierarch ical structure , biasing the estimates of the number of independent trials ( E[\ud835\udc3e]) and the false positive probability . Generally speaking, our approach is data -intensive and closer to the machine learning literature, whereas Harvey et al. \u2019s is closer to the econometrics literature. We advise readers to become familiar with both, as they can be seen as complementary. In particular , our unsupervised learning method for estimating the number of effectively uncorrelated tests (E[\ud835\udc3e]) should be useful to both approaches. 4. THE NORMALITY OF THE SHARPE RATIO Consider an investment strategy with excess returns (or risk premia) {\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61}, \ud835\udc61=1,\u2026,\ud835\udc47, which follow an IID Normal distribution , \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61~\ud835\udca9[\ud835\udf07,\ud835\udf0e2] where \ud835\udca9[\ud835\udf07,\ud835\udf0e2] represents a Normal distribution with mean \ud835\udf07 and variance \ud835\udf0e2. The SR (non - annualized) of such strategy is defined as \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45=\ud835\udf07 \ud835\udf0e Because parameters \ud835\udf07 and \ud835\udf0e are not known, SR is estimate d as \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302=E[{\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61}] \u221aV[{\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61}] Under the assumption that returns follow an IID Normal distribution, Lo [2002] derived the asymptotic distribution of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302 as (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302\u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45)\ud835\udc4e\u2192\ud835\udca9[0,1+1 2\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc452 \ud835\udc47] Equivalently, under the assumption that returns follow an IID Normal distribution, Harvey et al. [2015] transform \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302 into a t -ratio, which follows a t -distribution with \ud835\udc47\u22121 degrees of freedom . In this paper we refrain from following that approach, as empirical evidenc e shows that hedge Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=31670177 fund strategies exhibit substantial negative skewness and positive excess kurtosis (among others, see Brooks and Kat [2002], Ingersoll et al. [2007]) . Wrongly assuming that returns follow an IID Normal distribution can lead to a gross un derestimation of the false positive probability. Under the assumption that returns follow an IID non -Normal distribution, Mertens [ 2002] derived the asymptotic distribution of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302 as (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302\u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45)\ud835\udc4e\u2192\ud835\udca9[0,1+1 2\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc452\u2212\ud835\udefe3\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45+\ud835\udefe4\u22123 4\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc452 \ud835\udc47] where \ud835\udefe3 is the skewness of {\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61}, and \ud835\udefe4 is the kurtos is of {\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61} (\ud835\udefe3=0 and \ud835\udefe4=3 when returns follow a Normal distribution). Shortly after , Christie [2005] and Opdyke [2007] discovered that, in fact, Mertens\u2019 equation is also valid under the more general assumpt ion that returns are stationary and ergodic (not necessarily IID). The key implication is that \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302 still follows a Normal distribution even if returns are non -Normal, however with a variance that partly depends on the skewness and kurtosis of the returns. In the next section we utilize this result to express the SR statistic in the probabilistic space. Such metric can be used directly to determine the probability that a discovery made after a single trial is a false positive. 5. THE PROBABILISTIC SHARPE RATIO The probabilistic Sharpe ratio (PSR) provides a n adjusted estimate of the SR, by removing the inflationary effect caused by short series with skewed and/or fat -tailed returns . Given a user- defined benchmark level \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217, PSR estimates the probability that an observed \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302 exceeds \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217. Following Bailey and L\u00f3 pez de Prado [2012], PSR can be estimated as \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302[\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217]=\ud835\udc4d [ (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302\u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217)\u221a\ud835\udc47\u22121 \u221a1\u2212\ud835\udefe\u03023\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302+\ud835\udefe\u03024\u22121 4\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u03022] where \ud835\udc4d[.] is the CDF of the standard Normal distribution, T is the number of observed returns, \ud835\udefe\u03023 is the skewness of the returns, and \ud835\udefe\u03024 is the kurtosis of the returns . Note that \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302 is the non - annualized estimate of SR, computed on the same frequency as the T observations . For a given \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217, \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302 increases with greater \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302 (in the original sampl ing frequency, i.e. non -annualized), or longer track records ( T), or positively skewed returns ( \ud835\udefe\u03023), but it decreases with fatter tails ( \ud835\udefe\u03024). 6. THE FALSE STRATEGY THEOREM For the reader\u2019s convenience, i n this section we will discuss the theorem needed to further adjust \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302 for the inflationary effect caused by SBuMT . A proof of this statement can be found in Bailey et al. [2014].

Following Bailey and L\u00f3 pez de Prado [201 4], DSR can be estimated as \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302[\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217], where the benchmark SR (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217), is no longer user -defined. Instead, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217 is estimated as \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217=\u221aV[{\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302\ud835\udc58}]((1\u2212\ud835\udefe)\ud835\udc4d\u22121[1\u22121 \ud835\udc3e]+\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc4d\u22121[1\u22121 \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc52]) where V[{\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302\ud835\udc58}] is the variance across the trials\u2019 estimated SR, K is the number of independent trials , \ud835\udc4d[.] is the CDF of the standard Normal distribution , \ud835\udefe is the Euler -Mascheroni constant , and \ud835\udc58=1,\u2026,\ud835\udc3e. The rationale behind DSR is the following: Given a set of SR estimates, {\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302\ud835\udc58}, its expected maximum is greater than zero, even if the true SR is zero. Under the null hypothesis that the actual SR is zero, \ud835\udc3b0:\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45=0, we know that the expected maximum SR can be estimated as the \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217. Indeed, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217 increases quickly as more independent trials are attempted (K), or the trials involve a greater variance (V[{\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302\ud835\udc58}]). In order to reject the null hypothesis that the strategy is uninformed ( \ud835\udc3b0:\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45=0), the observed SR ( \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302) must be statistically significantly greater than the expected SR after controlling for SBuMT (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217). Thus, DSR gives us the confidence level, that is, the probability complementary to the false positive rate. For example, in order to reject the null hypothesis, \ud835\udc3b0:\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45=0, with a 5% significance level, the observed DSR must exceed 0.95. 8. PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS In practice, the estimation of the false positive probability requires the evaluation of six variables: 1. \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302 2. T Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=31670179 3. \ud835\udefe\u03023 4. \ud835\udefe\u03024 5. E[\ud835\udc3e] 6. E[V[{\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302\ud835\udc58}]] Of these six variables, (1) -(4) are either directly observable or can be estimated from the selected strategy. However, (5) -(6) are meta -research variables, in the sense that they are intrinsic to the research process itself, and they cannot be estimated from the selected strategy. There are two major reasons why (5) -(6) are usually unknown. First, i t is common for researchers to hide, not track , not report or unde rreport (5)-(6). The motivations may vary, and they could range all the way between negligence and outright fraud . Regardless of the motivations, the implication is that ignorance of (5) -(6) makes it impossible to assess whether a discovery is false . Secon d, even those careful and knowledgeable researchers who track every single trial that take s place face the problem that trials are not usually independent . The number of independent trials \ud835\udc3e is less or equal to the number of trials N. In the following sections , we will show how (5) -(6) can be estimated in practice . 8.1. ESTIMATION OF THE NUMBER OF CLUSTERED TRIALS , \ud835\udc04[\ud835\udc72] While finding independent trials may not be feasible, given that likely all strategies will be dependent to varying degrees, we consider clustering the strategies and using those clusters as a proxy. To that end, our goal is to develop an algorithm that, given \ud835\udc41 series , will partition the m into an optimal number of \ud835\udc3e subgroups, or clusters. Ideally, each c luster will have high intra - cluster correlations and low inter -cluster correlations. We denote this algorithm ONC, since it searche s for the optimal number of clusters within a correlation matrix . Given that our goal is to cluster correlated strategies, we first assume that we have a correlation matrix \ud835\udf0c for our strategies, where \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 is the correlation of the returns between strategies \ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc57. Next, we need a metric for clustering the strategies, specif ically one where higher correlations map to smaller (closer) distances. For this, we consider the proper distance matrix \ud835\udc37, where \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57=\u221a1 2(1\u2212\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57) for \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57=1,\u2026,\ud835\udc41. This definition of distance is a proper metric in the sense that it satisfies the four classical axioms: Non -negativity, identity, symmetric and sub -additivity. Furthermore, we wish to consider a more global distance rather than local distance for improved clustering.",

The reason is, while \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 is a direct function of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 (a single correlation), \ud835\udc37\u0303\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 incorporate s information about the entire system , thereby reducing noise and adding robustness to the procedure (L\u00f3pez de Prado [2016a]) . With the above formed distance matrix \ud835\udc37\u0303, we next consider the clustering methodology. One possibility would be to use the K-means algorithm on our distance matrix \ud835\udc37\u0303. While K -means is simple and frequently effective, it does have two notable limitations: First, t he algorithm requires a user -set number of clusters \ud835\udc3e, which is not necessarily optimal a priori. Second, t he initialization is random, and hence the effectiveness of the algorithm is similarly random. In order to address these two concerns, we need to modify the K -means algorithm . The f irst modification is to introduce an objective function, so that we can find the \u201coptimal \ud835\udc3e.\u201d For this, we utilize the silhouette score introduced by Rousseeuw [1987]. As a reminder, for a given node \ud835\udc56 and a given clustering, the silhouette score \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 is defined as \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56=\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 max{\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56} where \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 is the average distance between \ud835\udc56 and all other nodes in the same cluster, and \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56 is the smallest average distance between \ud835\udc56 and all the nodes in any other cluster. Effectively, this is a measure comparing intra -cluster distance and inter -cluster distance. A \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56=1 means that node \ud835\udc56 is clustered well, while \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56=\u22121 means that \ud835\udc56 was clustered poorly. Our measure of quality \ud835\udc5e for a given clustering is thus set to \ud835\udc5e=E[{\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56}] \u221aV[{\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56}] The second modification deals with K -mean\u2019s initialization problem. At the base level, our clustering algorithm performs the following operation: First, we are given a \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc41 correlation matrix \ud835\udf0c, from which we evaluate the distance matrices \ud835\udc37 and \ud835\udc37\u0303. Second , we perform a double for\u2026loop. In the first loop, we try different \ud835\udc58=2,\u2026,\ud835\udc41\u22121 on which to cluster via K -means for one given initialization, and evaluate the quality \ud835\udc5e for each clustering. The second loop repeat s the first loop multiple times , thereby obtaining different initializations. Third, o ver these two loops, we select the clustering with the highest \ud835\udc5e. See Snippet 1 in the Appendix for an implement ation of this operation in python. The third modification to K -means deals with clusters of inconsistent quality. The base clustering may capture the more distinct clusters, while missing the less apparent ones. To address this issue, we evaluate the quality \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc58 of each cluster \ud835\udc58=1,\u2026,\ud835\udc3e given the clustering and silhouette scores obtained from the base clustering algorithm. We then take the average quality \ud835\udc5e\u0305, and find the set of clusters with quality below average, {\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc58|\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc58<\ud835\udc5e\u0305,\ud835\udc58=1,\u2026,\ud835\udc3e}. Let us denote as \ud835\udc3e1 the number of clusters in the set, \ud835\udc3e1<\ud835\udc3e. If the number of clusters to rerun is \ud835\udc3e1\u22642, then we return Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=316701711 the clustering given by the base algorithm. However, if \ud835\udc3e1>2, we rerun the clustering of the items in those \ud835\udc3e1 clusters , while the rest are considered acceptabl y clustered . We rerun the \ud835\udc3e1 clusters in a recursive manner, rerunning the clustering on \ud835\udf0c, restricted to the nodes in the \ud835\udc3e1 clusters. Doing so will return a, possibly new, optimal clustering for those nodes. To check its efficacy, we compar e the average quality of the clusters to redo given the previous clustering to the average quality of the clusters given the new clustering. If the average quality improves for these clusters, we return the accepted clustering from the base clustering conc atenated with the new clustering for the nodes redone. Otherwise, we return the clustering formed by the base algorithm. See Snippet 2 in the Appendix for an implementation of this operation in python.

In this section, our goal is to utilize the clustering to reduce the \ud835\udc41 strategies to \ud835\udc3e\u226a\ud835\udc41 cluster -level strategies. Upon creation of these \u201ccluster strategies,\u201d we derive our estimat e E[V[{\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302\ud835\udc58}]] for each \ud835\udc58=1,\u2026,\ud835\udc3e. For a given cluster \ud835\udc58, the goal is to form an aggregate cluster returns time series \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61. This necessitates choosing a weighting scheme for the aggregation. We choose the minimum variance allocation, described in L \u00f3pez de Prado [2016 a], to mitigate the adverse effects of any strategies with larger variance. Let \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58 denote the set of strategies in cluster \ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 the returns series for strategy \ud835\udc56, \u03a3\ud835\udc58 the covariance matrix restricted to strategies in \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58, and \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc56, or \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc58 in vector notation, the weight for strategy \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58.

We need to express the estimated variance of clustered trials in terms of the frequency of the selected strategy , in order to match the frequency of the \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302 estimate used by the DSR equation ( recall Section s 5 and 7). Otherwise, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u2217 would not be estimated on the same frequency as \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc45\u0302. 9. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION OF \ud835\udc04[\ud835\udc72] We now design a Monte Carlo experiment to verify the accuracy of the ONC algorithm introduced in Section 8.1. Our goal is to create a \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc41 correlation matrix \ud835\udf0c from random data with a predefined number of blocks \ud835\udc3e, where \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 is high inside a blo ck and low outside the block. We can then verify that the ONC algorithm recovers the block s we injected . 9.1. GENERATION OF RANDOM BLOCK CORRELATION MATRICES First, given the tuple (\ud835\udc41,\ud835\udc40,\ud835\udc3e), we create a random block covariance matrix of size \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc41 , made up of \ud835\udc3e blocks, each of size \u2265\ud835\udc40. To do so, we randomly partition the \ud835\udc41 indices into \ud835\udc3e disjoint groups. Note that each block must be of size \ud835\udc40\u22652, as block s of size 1 are difficult to identify as a cluster. Let us describe the procedure for randomly partitioning \ud835\udc41 items into \ud835\udc3e groups , each of size at least \ud835\udc40. First, note that this is equivalent to randomly partitioning \ud835\udc41\u2032=\ud835\udc41\u2212\ud835\udc3e(\ud835\udc40\u22121) items into \ud835\udc3e groups each of size at least 1, so we reduce our analysis to that. Next, consider randomly choosing \ud835\udc3e\u22121 distinct items , denoted as a set \ud835\udc35, from the set \ud835\udc34=(1,\u2026,\ud835\udc41\u2032\u22121), then add \ud835\udc41\u2032 to \ud835\udc35, so that \ud835\udc35 is of size \ud835\udc3e. Thus, \ud835\udc35 contains \ud835\udc561,\u2026,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3e, where 1\u2264\ud835\udc561<\ud835\udc562<\u22ef<\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3e=\ud835\udc41\u2032. Given B, consider the \ud835\udc3e partition sets \ud835\udc361=0,\u2026,\ud835\udc561\u22121, \ud835\udc362=\ud835\udc561,\u2026,\ud835\udc562\u22121, \u2026, and \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3e=\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3e\u22121,\u2026,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3e\u2212 1. Given the \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 are distinct, each partition contains at least 1 element as desired, and furthermore completely partition s the s et (0,\u2026,\ud835\udc41\u2032\u22121).

EXTRACTION OF \ud835\udc04[\ud835\udc72] Using the above described procedure to create random \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc41 correlation matrices with \ud835\udc3e blocks of size at least \ud835\udc40, we test the efficacy of the ONC algorithm. For our simulations, we chose \ud835\udc41=20,40,80,160. We set \ud835\udc40=2, and thus necessarily \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc41\u22641 2. For each \ud835\udc41, we test \ud835\udc3e=3,6,\u2026, up to \ud835\udc41 2. Finally, we test 1000 random generations for each of these parameter sets. Exhibit 4 displays various boxplots for these simulations. In particular, for \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc41 in a given bucket, we display the boxplot of the ratio of \ud835\udc3e predicted by the clustering (deno ted E[\ud835\udc3e]) to the actual \ud835\udc3e tested. Ideally, this ratio should be near 1. We observe that this clustering is very effective, frequently obtaining the correct number of clusters, with some outliers. [EXHIBIT 4 HERE] As a reminder, in a boxplot, the central box has the bottom set to the 25% percentile of the dat a (Q1), while the top is set to the 75% percentile (Q3). The interquartile range (IQR) is set to Q3 - Q1. The median is displayed as a line inside the box. The \u201cwhiskers\u201d extend to the largest datum less than \ud835\udc443+1.5\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc45, and the smallest datum greater than \ud835\udc441\u20131.5\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc45. All points outside that range are considered outliers. 10. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we apply the False Strategy theorem , first proved in Bailey et al. [2014] , to the prevention of false positives in finance . This requires the estimation of two meta -research variables that allow us to discount for the likelihood of \u201clucky findings.\u201d We estimate these two meta -research variables with the help of the ONC algorithm . In particular, ONC extracts from a series of backtests the number of effectively uncorrelated trials. This number is useful in two applications: a) Estimating the expected value of the maximum Sharpe ratio, via the False Strategy Theorem (see Bailey and L\u00f3pez de Prado [2014] Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=316701714 for an example); and b) deriving the FWER, via the \u0160id\u00e1k correction (see Harvey and Liu [2015] for an example). Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate the precision of this method. We think that ONC has multiple uses in finance. Many investing problems involve the extraction of an unknown number of clusters. For example, ONC could be used to identify the optimal number of economic sectors from a risk perspective. Risk parity investors could then allocate assets in a more diversif ied way, where the peer groups are not set in advance. More generally, ONC could be useful in situations where researchers are interested in finding the most uncorrelated groups without a change of basis (like in principal components analysis , PCA ). This could be particularly helpful in addressing multicollinearity problems, where the standard PCA solution forces researchers to work with variables removed of economic intuition.

MINIMUM VARIANCE ALLOCATION In section 8.2, we wish to evaluate the minimum variance allocation for the strategies within a cluster \ud835\udc58 of size \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc58. Note that the intra -cluster correlations will be high by design, and thus \u03a3\ud835\udc58 may be ill -conditioned and difficult to invert. In practice, one could choose to approximate the weights by setting \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc56 proportional to 1 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc562 as is typically done in inver se variance allocations. If more accuracy is desired, consi der the following approximation. Let \ud835\udf0c be the average off - diagonal correlation in the correlation matrix for the cluster.

Below, H. Kent Baker and Victor Ricciardi describe some common behavioural biases and suggest how to mitigate them. \"The investor's chief problem \u2013 even his worst enemy \u2013 is likely to be himself.\" Benjamin Graham Why do investors behave as they do? Investor be-haviour often deviates from logic and reason. Emotional processes, mental mistakes, and in- dividual personality traits complicate investment decisions. Thus, investing is more than just analysing numbers and making decisions to buy and sell various assets and securi-ties. A large part of investing involves individual behav-iour. Ignoring or failing to grasp this concept can have a detrimental influence on portfolio performance. Behavioural biases in investing encompass many types. For example, cognitive biases refer to tendencies to think and act in certain ways. A cognitive bias can be viewed as a rule of thumb or heuristic, which can lead to systematic deviations from a standard of rationality or good judgment. Some controversy still exists about whether some of these biases are truly irrational or whether they result in useful attitudes or behaviour. Other biases are more emotional in nature. An emotional bias is one that results in taking action based on feelings instead of facts. Given that some overlap exists between cognitive and emotional biases, we simply call them behavioural biases. An important aspect of avoiding such biases is to become aware of them. Thus, by avoiding behavioural biases investors can more readily reach impartial decisions based on available data and logi-cal processes. Our purpose is to briefly discuss investor behaviour, re- view eight common behavioural biases, and then concen- trate on two types of investors \u2013 overconfident investors and status quo investors. Baker and Nofsinger (2002, 2010) and Baker and Ricciardi (2014) provide more detailed discus-sions of investor behaviour including behavioural biases.Investor Behaviour What is investor behaviour? The field of investor behav-iour attempts to understand and explain decisions by com-bining the topics of psychology and investing on a micro level (i.e., the decision process of individuals and groups) and a macro level (i.e., the role of financial markets). The decision-making process of investors incorporates both a quantitative (objective) and qualitative (subjective) aspect that is based on the features of the investment product or financial service. Investor behaviour examines the mental processes and emotional issues that individuals, financial experts, and traders reveal during the financial planning and investment management process. In practice, individu- als make judgments and decisions that are based on past events, personal beliefs, and preferences. They establish short cuts or heuristics that can save time but lead them away from rational, long-term thinking. Understanding investor behaviour can inform investors about these biases and help them improve their decision-making processes in selecting investment services, prod-ucts, and strategies. As a result of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the discipline of psychology began to focus even By avoiding behavioural biases investors can more readily reach impartial decisions based on available data and logical processes.How Biases Affect Investor Behaviour By H. Kent Baker and Victor RicciardiInsightFinance 8 The European Financial Review February - March 2014 more on the financial decision-making processes of individuals. This renewed interest by the social sciences and business disciplines has spurred new research on investor behaviour. Common Behavioural Biases Investors exhibit many biases. Few of these behavioural biases exist in isolation because deep interactions exist among different biases. None- theless, the following list represents some common biases facing investors but others may be equally important depending on the specific situation. Baker and Nofsinger (2002), Ricciardi (2008), iShares (2013), Parker (2013), and Seawright (2012) provide further discussion of behavioural biases and how to deal with them. 1. Representativeness. Represen- tativeness results in investors labeling an investment as good or bad based on its recent performance. Consequently, they buy stocks after prices have risen expecting those increases to continue and ignore stocks when their prices are below their intrinsic values. Investors should have a clearly defined analyti- cal process that they test and retest in order to refine and improve it over the long run. 2. Regret (loss) aversion.",

        "content": "Regret aversion describes the emotion of re- gret experienced after making a choice that turns out to be either a bad or inferior choice. Investors who are in-fluenced by anticipated regret are mo- tivated to take less risk because this lessens the potential of poor outcomes. Regret aversion can explain investor reluctance to sell \u201closing\u201d investments because it gives them feedback that they have made bad decisions. Disci- plined investing requires overcoming the reluctance to realise losses. 3. Disposition effect. Closely relat- ed to regret aversion is the disposition effect, which refers to the tendency of selling stocks that have appreciated in price since purchase (\u201cwinners\u201d) too early and holding on to losing stocks (\u201closers\u201d) too long. The disposition effect is harmful to investors because ments, they probably should have a more conservative and hence less risk investment portfolio. 6. Anchoring. Anchoring is the tendency to hold on to a belief and then apply it as a subjective reference point for making future judgments. Anchoring occurs when an individual lets a specific piece of information control his cognitive decision-mak- ing process. People often base their decisions on the first source of infor-mation to which they are exposed (e.g., an initial purchase price of a stock) and have difficulty adjusting or changing their views to new informa- tion. Many investors still anchor on the financial crisis of 2007-2008 as a bad experience. As Ricciardi (2012) notes, this results in a higher degree of worry, which can cause them to underweight equities in their portfo-lios because they are excessively risk- and loss-averse. To avoid anchoring investors should consider a wide range of investment choices and not focus their financial decisions on a specific reference point of information. 7. Self-attribution bias. Investors who suffer from self-attribution bias tend to attribute successful outcomes to their own actions and bad outcomes to external factors. They often exhibit this bias as a means of self-protection or self-enhancement. Investors af- flicted with self-attribution bias may become overconfident, which can lead to overtrading and underperformance. Keeping track of personal mistakes and successes and developing account- ability mechanisms such as seeking constructive feedback from others can help investors gain awareness of self-attribution bias. 8. Trend-chasing bias. Investors often chase past performance in the it can increase the capital gains taxes that investors pay and can reduce re-turns even before taxes. Following the advice of \u201ccut your losses and let your profits run\u201d enables investors to engage in disciplined investment man- agement that can generate higher re-turns. 4. Familiarity bias. This bias oc- curs when investors have a preference for familiar investments despite the seemingly obvious gains from diversi-fication. Investors display a preference for local assets with which they are more familiar (local bias) as well port- folios tilted toward domestic securities (home bias). An implication of famil-iarity bias is that investors hold sub-optimal portfolios. To overcome this bias, investors need to cast a wider net and expand their portfolio allocation decisions to gain wider diversification and risk reduction. Investing interna-tionally helps to avoid familiarity bias. 5. Worry. The act of worrying is an ordinary and unquestionably wide- spread human experience. Worry educes memories and visions of future episodes that alter an investor\u2019s judg-ment about personal finances. Based on survey evidence, Ricciardi (2011) finds that a much larger percentage of responding investors associate the word \u201cworry\u201d with common stocks (70 percent) as compared to bonds (10 percent). More anxiety about an investment increases its perceived risk and lowers the level of risk tolerance among investors. In turn, this concern increases the likelihood that investors will not buy the security. To avoid this bias, investors should match their lev-el of risk tolerance with an appropriate asset allocation strategy. As a quick test, if investors cannot sleep because of apprehension about their invest- \u201cRegret aversion can explain investor reluctance to sell \u201closing\u201d investments because it gives them feedback that they have made bad decisions.

        "content": "Research evidence demonstrates that investors do not benefit because performance typically fails to persist in the future. For example, using a sample of 1,020 domestic actively managed mutual funds, Soe and Luo (2012) show that using past performance as a strategy fails. For the five years ending March 2012, only about 5 percent of the funds maintained top-half performance rank-ings over five consecutive 12-month periods, while 6 per-cent were predicted to repeat by chance alone. To avoid this bias, investors should resist following the herd or jump- ing on the bandwagon. Although investors may feel better when investing with the crowd, such an investment strategy is unlikely to lead to superior long-term performance. These eight behavioural biases are some fundamen- tal issues investors might face at different periods during their lifetimes. Another important issue to consider is the amount of attention and time they should spend on their investment decisions because this might result in overconfi- dent or status quo behaviour. Two Different Types of Investors Most investors can be classified as either overconfident or sta- tus quo investors. Overconfident investors tend to be overly active traders and status quo investors display a lack of atten - tion to managing their portfolios. The best advice is to find an appropriate balance between the two types of investors. Overconfident Investors Investors often exhibit overconfident behaviour resulting in severe consequences. They may display overconfidence in both the quality of their information and their ability to act on it. Ricciardi (2008) observes that people tend to over- estimate their skills, abilities, and predictions for success. Research documents that overconfident behaviour is con-nected to excessive trading and results in poor investment returns. It can also lead to investors failing to appropriately diversify their portfolios. Barber and Odean (2001) study the role of trading be- haviour and gender bias for a sample of 35,000 individual accounts over a six-year period. Their findings reveal that males are not only more overconfident about their invest- ing abilities but also trade more often than females. Com-pared to women, men also tend to sell their stocks at the incorrect time resulting in higher trading costs. Women generally trade less and apply a \u201cbuy and hold\u201d approach resulting in lower trading costs. To resist this bias, investors need to recognise the signs of overconfidence such as attributing a few short-term \u201cwins\u201d to superior knowledge, abilities or skills. Short-term perfor-mance may be more a stroke of luck than security selection or market timing skill. Individual investors are unlikely to have better information, intuition or analytical powers than others. In fact, the market has made fools out of many respected but overconfident investment professionals. Ul-timately, individuals should be investing for the long-term rather than trading for the short-term. Status Quo Investors Some Investors suffer from status quo bias in which they tend to default to the same judgment or accept the current situation. Changing this inertia requires strong motivation or incentives. Status quo bias occurs when investors fail to update their economic conditions despite potential gains from doing so. Instead, they stick to a position, such as holding a stock instead of selling it or otherwise act in a suboptimal manner. People also tend to defer savings for retirement or postpone opening a retirement account. After entering a 401k retirement plan, many employees do not Most investors can be classified as either overconfident or status quo investors. Overconfident inves- tors tend to be overly active traders and status quo investors display a lack of attention to managing their portfolios. The best advice is to find an appropriate balance between the two types of investors. Status quo bias reveals the drawbacks of a simple \u201cbuy and hold\u201d strategy for long-term investors. To resist this bias, investors should implement a disciplined investment strategy. 10 The European Financial Review February - March 2014 About the Authors H.

Mitchell, Mottola, Utkus, and Yamaguchi (2006) exam- ine more than 1,500 company 401(k) plans with 1.2 million client accounts. Their evidence reveals that most savers exhibit severe inertia or inattention bias. Over a two-year period, most do not execute any trades. Status quo bias reveals the drawbacks of a simple \u201cbuy and hold\u201d strategy for long-term investors. To resist this bias, investors should implement a disciplined investment strategy based on a portfolio approach. For example, they should match their level of risk tolerance with a predeter-mined asset allocation. This asset allocation strategy may encompass a diverse collection of mutual funds including stocks, bonds, and real estate both nationally and interna-tionally. Another way to overcome status quo bias involves rebalancing a portfolio at least yearly. This helps to ensure that an investor\u2019s risk tolerance profile matches his asset allocation throughout the life of the long-term portfolio. By using active asset allocation investors tend to shift gains from risky assets (stocks) during bull markets to safer assets (bonds). During bear markets, they reallocate gains in the safer asset class (bonds) to the riskier asset class (stocks). Although this active asset allocation provides less upside gains during bull markets, it lessens downside risk during bear markets. Concluding Remarks Investors display many behaviour biases that influence their investment decision-making processes. We describe some common behavioural biases and suggest how to miti- gate them. Although investors cannot avoid all biases, they can reduce their effects. This requires understanding one\u2019s behavioural biases, resisting the tendency to engage in such behaviours, and developing and following objective invest-ment strategies and trading rules. Investors also need to invest for the long-term, identify their level of risk toler- ance, determine an appropriate asset allocation strategy, and rebalance portfolios at least yearly.",

To evaluate these concerns, we o er the rst trader-level analysis of modern retail option trading by introducing a novel data set of $15 billion in retail stock and option trades. Option trades constitute over one-third of all trades, are concentrated in a few underlyings, especially the S&P 500 index, and are dominated by short-term purchases. Surprisingly, option trades incur relatively small losses despite wide bid-ask spreads. Retail investors use options to participate in high-priced underlyings, with limited evidence of leverage or skewness-seeking in realized trade returns. While our average retail investor is relatively sophisticated, results remain robust across investor subsamples.1 Introduction Retail traders account for a substantial portion of stock trading volume, attracting signi cant public and regulatory attention. While retail stock trading has been extensively studied (Barber and Odean (2013)), the COVID-19 pandemic saw an in ux of new investors. These newcomers, often in uenced by social networks, are drawn to complex markets like options. The Options Clearing Corp reports a 35% increase in option trading volume between 2020 and 2021, largely attributed to growth in retail trading, which far outpaced the increase in stock trading volume.1 Indeed, Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Sikorskaya (2022) estimate that \\retail trading recently reached over 60% of total market volume\" in options, with retail brokers earning more from option trading than stock trading. This surge in retail option trading has raised widespread concerns. Some argue it resembles gambling, potentially resulting in signi cant losses (e.g., de Silva, Smith, and So (2023)). The wide bid-ask spreads in options could lead to large losses for active traders (e.g., Muravyev and Pearson (2020)). These concerns have prompted calls for stricter regulation of retail option trading (e.g., FINRA Regulatory Notice 22-08). We evaluate these concerns through the rst comprehensive study of modern retail investor behavior in the option market, using detailed trader-level data on both option and stock trades. Our data allow us to analyze individual behavior, pro tability, and trading motives, thus extending the growing literature on U.S. retail option trading that relies on proxies of aggregate retail behavior.2 We obtain our data from a trading journal provider. Trading journals are popular among investors for their advanced performance tracking and veri cation tools. Users link their brokerage accounts, allowing automatic and veri ed trade import. To maintain veri ed trade status, users cannot selectively import trades. The journal exclusively supports retail brokers, such as TD Ameritrade, which we con rm through reported broker IDs. The data set contains 5,182 traders who made 2.4 million parent trades (including 0.9 million option trades) worth about $15 billion between 2020 and 2022. Average trade sizes of $8,798 for stocks and $2,006 for options suggest that the journal tracks investors' primary trading accounts. Each parent trade consists of child trades 1For example, WSJ on September 26, 2021, https://www.wsj.com/articles/individuals-embrace-options-trading- turbocharging-stock-markets-11632661201 2For example, Bryzgalova et al. (2022) and Hendershott, Khan, and Riordan (2022) assume that all option trades submitted into single-leg auctions are retail. Eaton, Green, Roseman, and Wu (2023), de Silva et al. (2023), and Lipson, Tomio, and Zhang (2023) use the \\customer\" category of daily option volume (in the Options Open-Close Volume Summary data set), but this category includes both retail and institutional trades. 1that open and then close the initial position, or occasionally an option expiration record.",

        "content": "Thus, we observe detailed data on modern retail trading of stocks, options, or both. We assess how our ndings generalize from journal users to other retail investors after presenting the main results. We document several stylized facts about retail option trading. First, we con rm the growing popularity of options among retail investors. Option trading activity nearly matches stock trading activity by the end of our sample. The share of option trades in our data increases from 23% in January 2020 to 49% in December 2022. Strikingly, a quarter of all investors in our data trade only options and not stocks in a given month. Thus, despite the spotlight on retail stock trading, retail option trading is gaining comparable importance in our data. Second, retail investors in our data trade many stocks, but their option trading is concentrated in a few names. The ten most-traded option underlyings represent 60% of all option trades, with 26% linked to the S&P 500 index. Option trading becomes more concentrated as the top-ten share increases from 47% in 2020 to 74% in 2022. In contrast, stock trades are dispersed, and the ten most popular stocks represent only 9% of all stock trades, with Tesla and AMC at the top. A trader- level analysis shows that investors tend to trade di erent stocks but the same option underlyings. Despite thousands of stocks having listed options, retail option trading is heavily concentrated in a few underlyings. Therefore, a traditional per-stock analysis across all optionable stocks could present a skewed perspective. Third, our analysis of trade characteristics reveals that retail investors in our data primarily use options for short-term speculation. A typical retail option trade involves a purchase of a one-day call or put option linked to the S&P 500 index held for only an hour. Naked option selling is rare as option purchases dominate sales by 7-to-1. Indeed, many brokers either prohibit or require special permission for naked option selling. Thus, option purchases mainly open new positions, while option sales mainly close existing positions. Furthermore, retail investors tend to trade on short- term price swings. The median option maturity decreases from four days in 2020 to less than a day in 2022. Thus, our retail investors primarily trade zero days to expiration (0DTE) options in 2022, contributing to their popularity (Beckmeyer, Branger, and Gayda (2023)). Finally, the holding period is highly skewed, with a 3.5-day average but only a half-hour median. This observation challenges xed holding horizons assumed by prior studies of retail trading pro tability. We evaluate concerns about retail losses. Retail investors break even on their stock trades, 2consistent with small bid-ask spreads and unpredictable returns. On the option side, an average option trade in our data earns a \u00000.9% return, which is small compared to typical option bid-ask spreads of 5% to 10% and is comparable to trading fees. Retail traders likely rely on limit orders to avoid paying the spread. Option trade pro tability varies from -5% to 1% across subsamples. Naked option sales are the exception and earn 20% on average, which is consistent with Bryzgalova et al. (2022). These ndings suggest that concerns about large retail losses in options may be overstated. Our pro tability estimates contrast with Bryzgalova et al. (2022) and de Silva et al. (2023), who report losses of 3% to 9% per trade based on aggregate retail proxies. The di erence arises from the proxy limitations, di erences in analysis units, endogenous holding periods, and investor sophistication. The \\single-leg auction\" proxy considers only market orders that cross the spread, while the \\open-close\" proxy lacks trade prices, a ecting pro tability calculations. Both proxies assume a xed holding period (e.g., one day) and analyze an average stock. However, retail option trading is concentrated in few underlyings, with highly skewed holding periods. Retail investors in our data primarily trade options to participate in high-priced underlyings. Indeed, the price of a median stock trade is $8, whereas the underlying price of a median option trade is much higher at $262 (excluding S&P 500 trades). Retail traders favor options over stocks for high-priced stocks, even within the same trader or stock, controlling for size, volatility, and other characteristics.",

Traders in our data can achieve the same position by buying seven shares instead of a hundred and thus rarely require fractional shares.3Evidence from stock splits further supports the a ordability hypothesis. As a stock becomes more a ordable to trade post split, investors in our data increase their propensity to trade the stock relative to options on the stock by about 10%. Embedded leverage is often considered a primary reason for option trading, as a long option can generate higher pro ts than a similar investment in the underlying, given favorable price movements. Surprisingly, retail investors in our data achieve only modest realized leverage from option trading. The realized leverage would be evident if absolute dollar pro ts were higher for option trades than stock trades. While option purchases do generate about $110 larger absolute dollar pro t than 3Most of the brokers in our data set do not allow fractional shares, and even for those who do, we con rm the large di erence between the underlying price for option and stock trades. 3stock trades|a statistically signi cant di erence with or without trader xed e ects|this amount is economically small, accounting for only 1.3% of an average stock trade size. Although options inherently o er higher leverage than stocks, retail option trades are 4.4 times smaller on average. These o setting e ects result in modest realized leverage on option trades. Similarly, preference for positive skewness, often associated with gambling behavior, is nota major driver of retail option purchases in our data.4Long option positions held until expiration can generate lottery-like payo s with large potential pro ts and limited losses. But we nd that this payo skewness does not translate into positive skewness in traders' pro ts. We rst assess the asymmetry in the distribution of dollar trade pro ts. Stock trades show a symmetric P&L distri- bution. Option trades also display an almost symmetric P&L distribution. For option purchases, the 10th and 90th percentiles are -$296 and $217 respectively, indicating slight negative skewness, with similar results in the tails of the distribution.5With the same trader, realized dollar return skewness of both option and stock trades is negative and not statistically di erent (at the level of 1%). An option trade's pro t deviates from the theoretical option payo due to short holding periods. Also, retail traders in our data have a tendency to realize gains earlier than losses on option purchases, which adds negative skewness. Our analysis reveals that covered calls, protective puts, and other concurrent stock-option positions are rare among our retail traders. For example, covered calls constitute less than 0.2% of all option trades. Despite being taught in every derivatives course and promoted by brokers, retail investors in our data overwhelmingly prefer simple single-leg strategies. We estimate that at most 15% of all option trades represent popular multi-leg (\\complex\") option trades. This suggests that retail investors use complex strategies less frequently than non-retail investors, as at least one-third of all option trades are complex (Li, Musto, and Pearson (2023)). All previous results remain robust when complex trades are excluded. While this paper o ers, to our knowledge, the rst trader-level analysis of modern retail option trading, it focuses on investors who opted to use a trading journal. These traders may be relatively more sophisticated than other retail investors since they nd a journal valuable, trade relatively 4For example, Boyer and Vorkink (2014) note that options provide large ex ante skewness and nd more negative returns for options with larger ex ante skewness (i.e., more out-of-the-money). 5Even percentage returns, instead of dollar pro ts, are slightly negatively skewed until -100% returns become binding for option purchases at the 1st percentile.

        "content": "We assess the extent to which the results could generalize to other retail investors. We rst show a strong positive correlation between stock trading imbalance in our data and established measures of retail imbalance, such as the change in the number of Robinhood investors holding a stock (Barber et al. (2022), Eaton et al. (2022)) and the Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang (2021) retail order imbalance, controlling for the Lee and Ready (1991) imbalance. Option volume in our data is positively related to the retail option measure of Bryzgalova et al. (2022), controlling for total option volume. Finally, TD Ameritrade's trading activity in our data increased relative to other brokers after TD introduced zero-commission trading. Our analysis reveals signi cant heterogeneity among retail investors, such as holding periods ranging from less than an hour to weeks. We exploit this heterogeneity to validate our ndings across various trader characteristics. Since active traders, who dominate retail volume, are more likely to use trading journals, we con rm our ndings for less active traders, as measured by trade count and holding period. We further explore how results vary across brokers, average trade sizes, option usage, and other trader subsamples. By employing trader xed e ects, we con rm that our key results are robust to individual investor characteristics, reducing concerns about sample- speci c biases. Finally, to address a potential bias from journal sign-up being in uenced by past performance, we analyze trades before and after the sign-up date. Our results appear robust, yet our ndings should be interpreted with caution because we only observe a subset of retail investors. Overall, our main ndings arise from the unique trader-level nature of our data. This granularity enables us to compare option trades to stock trades by the same investor, and precisely measure realized trade pro tability, leverage, and skewness, accounting for actual holding periods. Related Literature. A growing literature studies retail trading in options using aggregate proxies for retail trading. Option retail trading exploded in popularity recently (Bryzgalova et al. (2022)), but retail trading proxies suggest that retail investors su er large losses (de Silva et al. (2023), Bryzgalova et al. (2022), Beckmeyer et al. (2023)). Retail trading also can a ect implied volatility (Eaton et al. (2023)) and underlying stock volatility (Lipson et al. (2023)). Lakonishok et al. (2007) nd that the least sophisticated investors were chasing dot-com bubble by buying calls on growth stocks. Our study provides the rst detailed analysis of how modern retail investors 5jointly trade options and stocks, leveraging trader-level data to o er new insights into pro tability and trading motives. Our ndings nuance the common concern that retail investors view options as lottery tickets or leverage sources, resulting in large losses. To our knowledge, only Bauer, Cosemans, and Eichholtz (2009) study trader-level behavior and performance in options prior to our work. These authors show that clients of a Dutch online broker from 2000 to 2006 primarily gambled with options and incurred large losses. Our results for trade motives and performance in the modern U.S. sample di er signi cantly. Hu, Kirilova, Park, and Ryu (2023) nd that most retail investors in KOSPI 200 options hold simple one-sided positions, which is consistent with our results for the U.S. options market. Our study of joint retail trading in stocks and options contributes to the literature on retail stock trading.6Kogan et al. (2023) show that retail investors trade crypto di erently than stocks. Similarly, we nd that retail investors in our data trade options di erently than stocks, which is a much closer asset class. Retail option trading is concentrated in a few option underlyings (indices and high-price technology stocks) but their stock trading is spread across many tickers (mostly low- price stocks). Moreover, despite the proliferation of option trading, retail traders rarely combine option and stock positions in the same underlying (e.g., very few covered calls). Thus, pro tability and other analyses can be conducted separately on stock and option trades. We also nd that stock trades break even on average, and their pro t distribution is symmetric. Even if traders seek positive skewness, they do not achieve it, consistent with Fedyk (2022).",

We obtain our data from a popular trading journal provider. Investors use a trading journal to track and analyze their trades.7Third- 6This literature is extensive. Barber and Odean (2013) summarize earlier work that includes seminal papers such as Barber and Odean (2000, 2001). More recent studies (e.g., Welch (2022); Barber et al. (2022); Eaton et al. (2022); Ozik, Sadka, and Shen (2021); Chapkovski, Khapko, and Zoican (2021); Dyhrberg, Shkilko, and Werner (2022); Kogan et al. (2023)) shed light on the behavior of the new generation of retail investors. 7We use the terms investor, trader, and account interchangeably. 6party trading journals often o er more advanced features than the analytical tools provided by brokers. For example, these journals allow users to import trade data automatically from many retail brokers, tag and lter trades, and generate a range of reports to help them analyze and improve their trading performance. Once users connect their broker or trading platform, trades are automatically veri ed and imported into the journal, ensuring that the data in the journal accurately re ects the trader's actual activity. The trading journal that we use makes customer trades public by default, which the overwhelm- ing majority of users do not change. Thus, anyone can observe their trading journals. We extract users' pro le and trade history for 5,182 traders. A typical pro le includes basic user information such as an id number, nickname, self-reported location, and account-creation and last-login dates. Users can also follow each other but few do so.8This suggests that traders primarily use the journal to monitor their performance. Importantly, a user pro le also includes veri ed data on up to 1,000 consecutive round-trip \\parent\" trades made by a trader in her brokerage account. The trade history often predates the journal creation, and about 43% of trades are made after account creation. Even if a user stops logging into the journal, trades continue to be automatically loaded. We later use the post-creation trades to compare trade performance pre and post account creation in Section 4. Each parent trade involves opening and closing a position in a stock or option. A parent trade reports detailed information such as the symbol (e.g., \\TSLA\" or \\SPY|210707P00433000\"), whether the opening trade is short or long, the broker ID (e.g., \\TD\"), entry and exit dates, percentage return, and dollar return (for some trades). We require all of our trades to be matched to CRSP by ticker and date except for S&P 500 option trades, which are matched separately to the index. Before matching, the data set contains about 2.2 million parent trades between 2020 and 2022.9We are able to match 2.1 million parent trades, or about 95% of trades, which indicates that most trades are in U.S. stocks and options. Some of the unmatched trades are in futures and mostly associated with accounts specialized in trading futures. We also exclude a small number of trades in cryptocurrencies. The lack of crypto trading is not surprising as major retail brokers 876% of accounts do not follow any account, and 87% of accounts do not have any follower. 9Some of the collected trades occur before the 2020-2022 sample period, but there are only few of them. We also collected the data for 2022 trades that were closed in 2023 to avoid potential biases due to missing uncompleted trades at the end of the sample. 7didn't facilitate crypto trading during our sample, and retail traders have to go directly to crypto exchanges. Thus, almost all investors in our data trade only U.S. stocks and options. Furthermore, we compare the order of reported return on stock parent trades to the stock's CRSP return over the holding period. This comparison ags accounts with abnormal reported returns. For example, we exclude few accounts for which option trades are mistakenly reported as stock trades . The data set includes the percentage return on each parent trade but does not report trade size and price.",

        "content": "We separately collect additional information for a random sample of about 50% of all traders. This additional data set contains parent order size as well as child trades behind a parent trade. Each parent trade includes one or more child trades that open (or increase) the initial position, followed by one or more child trades that close (or decrease) the position or, occasionally, an option expiration record. Child trades report time stamps up to a second (e.g., \\09:43:06 AM\"), trade direction (\\SHORT\" or \\LONG\"), price, and size. They also con rm parent trade information about the symbol, contract parameters, enter and exit dates, holding period, percentage and dollar gains. We use the reported price of child trades to compute the average price of each parent trade. In total, the data set includes 1,311,816 (794,692) stock (option) parent trades, including 704,041 (343,320) trades with complete price and size information. The 1.3 million parent stock trades are worth about 11.9 billion dollars (counting buy and sell sides only once) and the 0.8 million option parent trades are worth about 8.8 billion dollars. Overall, the data set let us provide the rst direct look into how modern retail investors trade stocks and especially options. 2.2 Basic Trade Statistics We rst examine descriptive statistics at the trader level. Table 1 reports characteristics of stock and option trades in our data set by trader in Panel (A) and by trader-month in Panel (B). The results are broadly consistent across the two panels. Out of the 5,182 investors in our data set, 4,783 trade at least some stocks and 2,720 trade at least some options. About half of all investors do not trade options, but about a tenth of all investors trade options exclusively. An average investor trades 98 unique stocks and 42.5 unique option underlyings over her tenure in our data set (Panel (A)) and 13.8 stocks and 9.2 underlyings over a typical month (Panel (B)). The pattern is similar but less dramatic for the median investor. Thus, option trading is more 8concentrated than stock trading, which we further explore later. Also, modern retail investors in our data set trade many symbols and frequently adjust the set of symbols they trade. This result contrasts with the conventional wisdom that retail investors only trade a handful of familiar symbols (Barber and Odean (2000)). Investors are much more exposed to new investments through social media and their broker than in the age of over-the-phone trading. Finally, an average investor makes 26.1 stock trades and 15.2 option trades per month with substantial variation across investors. Most of our analyses are at the trade level. Table 2 reports descriptive statistics for stock trades in Panel (A) and option trades in Panel (B). Our data set contains 1,525,497 round-trip parent stock trades and 889,967 option trades. This is more than in the classic data set of Barber and Odean (2000), which contains less than one million round-trip stock trades and a negligible number of option trades, which they exclude. Table 2 shows that trade size is substantial, even though we winsorize dollar trade size at 0.01% and 99.9% to avoid potential reporting mistakes. Stock trades have an average (median) trade size of $8,798 ($1,620). Option trades have an average (median) trade size of $2,006 ($337). These trade averages are quite close to the trader and trader-month averages reported in Table 1, though trade size varies across investors. For comparison, an average stock purchase in the Barber and Odean (2000) data set is $11,205, which is about twice as large as in our data after adjusting for in ation. In contrast, the eToro investors studied by Kogan et al. (2023) have an average trade size of $311 and account balance of $987.10Thus, our data set primarily contains regular active retail investors rather than investors who put a few hundred dollars in their secondary \\play\" account. Indeed, TD Ameritrade, the most popular brokerage in our data, has an average account size of $243,000 as of Q1 2022, which appears consistent with the average trade size that we observe.11 The large dollar trade size suggests that the journal features investors' primary trading accounts.",

        "content": "The data contain trades from eight distinct brokers, in contrast to prior studies that typically rely on data from a single broker (most notably, Barber and Odean (2000)). Broker heterogeneity is important because brokers cater to di erent retail clienteles. Retail investors are very heterogeneous. Therefore, no data set can be perfectly representative 10Barber and Odean (2000) analyze a now widely-used data set of 78,000 investors (66,465 of whom have positions in common stocks) at a large discount brokerage rm between 1991 and 1996.

How appropriate a given data set depends on a particular research question. For our data set, active traders are more likely to use the journal than buy-and-hold investors. Since these investors disproportionately contribute to stock and option volumes, this makes them the appropriate group to focus on when characterizing a typical retail trade. Furthermore, we con rm our main results for trader subsamples and xed e ects that hope to capture retail heterogeneity. 3 Stylized Facts about Retail Trading This section documents stylized facts about the trading behavior of modern retail investors in stocks and options. To preview, a typical retail option trade in our data involves the purchase of a one-day call or put option linked to the S&P 500 index held for only an hour. First, we con rm the increasing popularity of options among retail investors. Figure 1 Panel (A) shows that the proportion of option trades relative to all trades increased from 23% to 49% between 2020 and 2022. By the end of our sample period, retail investors traded options nearly as frequently as stocks. On the extensive margin, Panel (B) reveals that the proportion of accounts trading options increased from 29% to 51%. Interestingly, despite a spike in retail trading activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, the ratio of option-to-stock retail trading remained stable, as shown in Figure 1. Finally, Panel (C) documents an increase from 15% to 38% in the proportion of investors trading only options (and not stocks) from 2020 to 2022. This notable trend suggests that many retail investors have become su\u000eciently comfortable with option trading to deviate from \\traditional\" stock trading. While previous studies have documented the rise in retail option trading, our study provides important context by demonstrating that the proportion of option trading by retail investors has increased relative to stock trading, both in aggregate and within individual investors. The 'options-only' trend highlights a signi cant shift in retail trading behavior. Second, while retail investors trade a wide array of stocks, their option trading is concentrated in a select few names. Figure 2 displays the top ten most actively traded stocks and options underlyings in our dataset. Option trades are notably concentrated, with the ten most traded option underlyings accounting for as much as 60% of all option trades. This concentration has intensi ed over time, with the share of the top ten underlyings rising from 47% to 74% from 2020 to 2022. Challenging conventional wisdom, ETF and index options, often associated with 10institutional trading, dominate retail option activity. SPY and SPX options alone constitute 26% of all retail option trades. The remaining top options are primarily linked to QQQ and major technology stocks, re ecting retail investors' focus on liquid, high-price underlyings. In contrast, stock trades are more dispersed, with the ten most popular stocks accounting for only 9% of all trades. Tesla and AMC top the list, accounting for 2.1% and 1.8% of all stock trades, respectively. The remainder of the top list is made up of esoteric high-risk investments including a 3x leveraged version of QQQ (TQQQ), Game Stop (GME), and a Chinese electric vehicle maker (NIO). This dichotomy in trading patterns suggests that retail investors approach options and stocks with distinctly di erent strategies and preferences. The contrast in stock-option trade concentration can be attributed to variations among traders. Investors trade di erent stocks but the same option underlyings. Table 1 shows that a median investor trades seven distinct stocks and ve distinct underlyings in a month, but over her tenure, she trades 51 stocks versus only 25 option underlyings.",

        "content": "Thus, traders are more likely to try new stocks but are more reluctant to switch option underlyings. Furthermore, there must be signi cant overlap in option underlyings across accounts to generate the concentration in Figure 2. Table 2 also shows that purchases (i.e., trades that open new long position) constitute 87% of option trades, while sales account for only 13%, resulting in a 7-to-1 buy-sell ratio. Thus, naked option selling is rare. This is not surprising, as many brokers either prohibit or require special permission for naked option selling. Consequently, option purchases predominantly open new positions, while option sales primarily close existing ones. Interestingly, while the majority of stock trades establish long positions, short sales constitute 36% of all stock trades. This suggests that retail short selling is more prevalent than previously thought. Table 2 also documents other interesting facts. For single stock options, call trades outnumber put trades by about 2-to-1. However, the put-call ratio is almost balanced for index and ETF options. Relatedly, naked option sales are also concentrated in index and ETF options, suggesting that retail investors di erentiate between equity and index options. Most trades occur in at-the- money (ATM) or slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) options. Retail investors tend to bet on short-term price swings, with the median option maturity of their trades decreasing from four days in 2020 to just one day in 2022. 0DTE constitute 23% of all option trades, and they became increasingly popular towards the end of the sample period. 1188% of stock trades are day trades (i.e., closed on the same day as opened), whereas 68.8% of option trades are day trades. For a subset of trades with detailed trade timestamps, the median holding period is 0.12 hours for stocks and 0.54 hours for options. The holding period distribution is extremely right-skewed with average holding times of 64.1 and 82.8 hours for stock and option trades, respectively. We will explore this heterogeneity in holding period to con rm our main results for subset of longer-horizon investors. 4 Why Do Investors Trade Options? This section explores potential motivations behind options trading. Our data allow us to evalu- ate concerns regarding retail losses and gambling tendencies in options. We consider alternative explanations: retail investors are attracted to options due to their low price and high embedded leverage. Furthermore, we assess the prevalence of complex multi-leg option strategies. 4.1 Pro tability We start by studying the pro tability of retail option trades. Based on a sample of nearly 890,000 parent option trades, Table 2 reveals that an average (median) option trade yields a return of \u00000:9% (1.0%). These moderately negative returns include broker commissions and liquidity costs from crossing the bid-ask spread. In fact, the returns' magnitude is comparable to typical option trading commissions. For example, TD Ameritrade charges $0.65 per option contract, paid both on entry and exit. For an average trade of 6 contracts and $2,006, this commision translates to about 0.4% of trade value. Notably, the observed losses on retail option trades are much smaller than typical option bid-ask spreads, which range from 5% to 10% or more. Perhaps, retail traders avoid paying the spread by employing limit orders. Finally, our pro tability estimates indicate that concerns regarding substantial retail losses in options may be somewhat overstated. They also contrast with prior literature, which documents losses ranging from 3% to 9% per option trade, which are based on aggregate retail proxies that predominantly rely on market orders. We examine variation in trade pro tability across trade categories in Table 3. Returns are winsorized at the 0.01% and 99.99% levels to mitigate the impact of extreme option return outliers on sample averages. The results are similar for unwinsorized returns, though statistical signi cance 12is weaker. We regress option trade returns on a constant and indicators for short-sale trades, call option trades, 0DTE options, index/ETF option trades, back lled trades, TD Ameritrade broker (the most popular in our sample), and an active investor indicator (more than 500 trades). The back lled indicator equals one for trades completed before the account creation date. The rst column of Table 3 sets the baseline: an average option trade earns a -0.93% return with a -3.57 t-statistic.",

        "content": "We then explore pro tability variations in option trade subsamples using univariate regressions, later supplementing with multivariate analysis controlling for time trends and xed e ects. We document several dimensions in which option trade pro ts deviate from the average. Most notably, naked option sales (only 13% of all option trades) are pro table, earning a 20% return. In contrast, option purchases lose 3.95% on average. This nding is broadly consistent with Bryzgalova et al. (2022), who nd that option sales are more pro table than option purchases. Index/ETF option trades earn a -3% return versus a 0.15% return for single-stock option. This nding goes against the hypothesis that retail investors use options to gamble and lose on individual stocks. 0DTE option trades lose 4.5% more than other option trades ( t-statistic of -10), while non 0DTE trades earn 0.19%. 0DTE options have much lower prices and thus much larger relative bid-ask spreads that can lead to larger loses. We nd no statistically signi cant di erences between brokers or between calls and puts. We further examine how the above trade categories jointly relate to pro tability after controlling for date and trader xed e ects. Trader xed e ects are especially useful as they highlight within- trader variation in pro tability. The last three columns of Table 3 report the results that are generally consistent with the univariate analysis and are robust across xed e ect speci cations. For example, naked option sales earn a 29% (incremental) return with controls and xed e ects, which is similar to the 24% unconditional incremental return. Pro tability results for 0DTE and index option trades become less dramatic after adding controls. With all controls, 0DTE trades lose\u00002:95% more than other trades compared to \u00004:7% in a univariate regression. We compare speci cations with and without trader xed e ects to estimate clientele e ects. We nd no marked di erences except that within a trader, index trades perform similarly stock option trades. The results in Table 3 also helps us assess two potential data limitations. First, do more active traders, who are more likely to sign up for the journal, perform di erently than less active traders? More active traders (with more than 500 trades) earn a 0.27% higher return per trade, but the 13di erence with less active traders is not statistically signi cant (a 0.58 t-statistic). Another concern is that traders are more likely to start a trading journal after a period of above-average performance, which then reverts back to the mean after the journal creation. Fortunately, we observe the account creation date, and almost half of the trades in our sample date from the pre-journal period. In a univariate regression, back lled option trades lose on average \u00000:54% versus\u00001:25% for non- back lled trades, and the di erence is not statistically signi cant at conventional levels. With controls, the di erence between back lled and non-back lled trades drops to 0 :27%. The di erence increases to 0 :52% with a 1.47 t-statistic once trader xed e ects are included. Finally, with both trader and date xed e ects, the di erence increases to 1.21% with a t-statistic of 2.85. While the back ll bias appears relatively small in our data set, we con rm our main results in the sample of non-back lled trades in the corresponding sections. Overall, while option returns are expectedly volatile, their averages are relatively small in most subsamples. One exception is large gains from naked option selling. The average trade returns that we document stand in stark contrast to systematic catastrophic losses from retail option trading alluded to in the prior literature and popular press. In Table 4, we study average returns for stock trades and how they depend on trade characteris- tics. As for the option return analysis, we winsorize stock returns at 0.01% and 99.99% and regress stock trade returns on a constant and the same indicator variables as for option trades (obviously without call and 0DTE indicators). The intercept-only regression reveals that an average stock trade is pro table with a 0.13% return and a 3.3 t-statistic.",

This result is consistent with short-sellers being informed. Interestingly, ETF trades earn a 0.23% lower return than single stock trades. The stock trade returns are slightly lower for active traders but this is not statistically signi cant (with t-statistics of\u00001:44). However, there is evidence of back ll bias for stock trades. Back lled stock trades earn a 0.27% higher return, while non-back lled trades earn zero return \u00000:02%). Finally, clients of TD Ameritrade earn a \u00000:01% return while clients of over brokers earn a 0.17% return. This re- sult highlight the importance of accounting for broker heterogeneity as brokers tailor to particular clienteles. Overall, most categories of stock trades (except for short sales) earn a near-zero return. 144.2 Option A ordability Turing to trading motives, we show that retail investors are drawn to options trading primarily due to their low price. Simply put, options let investors bet on high-priced stocks. Table 2 unveils a striking disparity: a median stock trade has a price of $8, while the underlying price of a median option trade is much higher, reaching $262 (S&P 500 option trades excluded). This striking price di erence is not only observed across di erent types of trades but also within individual traders. Consequently, it appears that investors look for a more cost-e ective substitute for stock purchases. The capital required for a median stock trade is substantially less than the amount needed to buy a hundred shares at $254. Investors can buy 7-10 shares to get similar exposure but prefer buying options instead. We further con rm the a ordability hypothesis in a regression analysis that documents di er- ences in characteristics between option and stock trades. An indicator variable is set to one for option trades and zero for stock trades. We then regress this indicator on stock characteristics measured at the end of the last month. The characteristics include log of stock price, idiosyncratic volatility and skewness (relative to the Fama-French model estimated on the past month of daily data), maximum daily return over the previous month, CAPM beta, and log of market capital- ization. Month-year xed e ect control for general market trends. Trader xed e ects (in some speci cations) help us study how the same investor chooses between stocks and options. The sam- ple includes all trades except for ETF and index-linked trades because we do not observe market capitalization for them. This exclusion works against the a ordability hypothesis because retail investors frequently trade ETF options, and ETFs often have high prices. The results in Table 5 con rm that option trades have a much higher underlying stock price than stock trades. Log stock price remains highly signi cant even controlling for trader xed e ects with a coe\u000ecient of 0.048 and t-statistics of 23. Option trades concentrate in large cap stocks, which is expected because many small-cap stocks have few and highly illiquid options. But stock price remains signi cant even after controlling for market capitalization and other characteristics. Interestingly, volatility, skewness, max return, and beta are not strongly associated with the choice of trading options over stock and often in the unexpected direction, even though these characteristics are motivated by theories of investor attention and skewness preference. The last column of the 15table shows that, once we include stock xed e ects, stock price is the only characteristics that remains signi cantly associated with trading an option over the underlying stock. Stock splits provide an opportunity to establish a more causal relation between stock prices and retail trading patterns. The a ordability hypothesis suggests that the propensity to trade options relative to the underlying stock should decrease after a stock split, as the reduced stock price makes direct trading more accessible to retail investors.12 To test this hypothesis, we analyze trading activity in the 60 days before and after stock splits, excluding the seven days around the event to mitigate the potential impact of short-term attention- driven trading.",

        "content": "We start with all stock splits and then restrict the sample to events with su\u000ecient trading activity in our data. Speci cally, we select stock split events that exhibit at least 100 stock and option trades in our data both before and after the split, resulting in 11 split events.13For each split event, we construct a two-stock control group with similar pre-split price, number of option trades, and number of stock trades. We employ a di erence-in-di erences panel design, where the rst di erence compares stocks that had a split (treatment sample) with similar stocks that did not (control sample), and the second di erence compares split stocks before and after the event. Table 6 presents regression results for the propensity to trade stocks or options on indicators for the post-split period. The rst two columns examine how retail activity in stocks and options separately changes after a split. For the stock trade sample, column (1) regresses an indicator variable for treated (i.e., split) stock trades on a post-split indicator, controlling for event xed e ects. Stock trades are 11.7% more likely post split for event stocks relative to control stocks. The increased stock activity is statistically signi cant with a 1.99 t-statistic. This is consistent with the view that a split-induced decrease in stock price makes it more a ordable and attracts more retail stock trading. Similarly, column (2) analyzes option trades, regressing an indicator for treated option trades on a post-split indicator, controlling for event xed e ects. A treated stock exhibits 6.4% fewer option trade in the post-split period compared to option trades in matched stocks, albeit the decrease is not statistically signi cant (a 1.69 t-statistic). Thus, retail trading activity increases in the underlying stock following a split, while option trading activity remains 12We thank Svetlana Bryzgalova for suggesting this test. Bryzgalova et al. (2022) examine micro-sized trading activity in option auctions surrounding the stock splits of Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) on August 28, 2020. 13The tickers included are AAPL, AMZN, GME, NVDA, TSLA, GOOG, SHOP, and TQQQ. This lter excludes reverse splits, which typically occur in low-price stocks with minimal option trading activity. Our results remain robust when including the days around the split event. 16relatively unchanged or decreases. After establishing these results, we focus on joint stock and option trading. Column (3) of Table 6 examines the substitution between stock and option trading after a stock split. We regress an indicator variable for option trades (one for option trades and zero for stock trades) on indicators for post-split trades, treated trades, and their interaction; as before, we also control for event xed e ects. In the pre-split period, the propensity to trade options relative to stocks between treated and matched stocks does not change signi cantly. However, supporting the a ordability hypothesis, the interaction term between post-split and treated indicators is negative ( \u00009.9%) and highly statistically signi cant (a \u00004.41 t-statistic). This nding suggests that as stocks become more a ordable to trade directly, some investors shift their trading activity from options to the underlying stocks. 4.3 Embedded Leverage High embedded leverage is often considered a primary reason for trading options. A long option theoretically provides embedded leverage, potentially yielding larger pro ts than the same invest- ment in the underlying stock, given a favorable price movement. Indeed, Table 8 con rms that options purchases o er more extreme percentage returns than stocks, 35% vs. 5%, respectively, at the 90th percentile, or about 7-to-1 leverage for the same dollar investment. However, we nd that retail investors in our data set do not fully utilize this embedded leverage. An average option trade is 4.4 times smaller than an average stock trade ($2,006 vs. $8,798 as shown in Table 2), which also holds within trader. This smaller trade size o sets most of the potential leverage e ect. To assess realized leverage, we compare absolute dollar pro ts between option and stock trades. If leverage were a driving force behind option trading, we would expect substantially higher absolute dollar pro ts from option trades.",

        "content": "Our analysis reveals that option trades do generate larger absolute dollar pro ts than stock trades, but the di erence is economically small. Speci cally, Table 7 presents a within-trader regression analysis, controlling for trader and date xed e ects. Option trades generate absolute dollar gains that are $110 to $120 higher than stock trades. While this di erence is statistically signi cant, it represents only about 1.3% of the average stock trade size. This e ect is economically modest and broadly comparable to the leverage e ect investors can achieve simply by trading stocks on margin (2-to-1 leverage). 17Interestingly, retail investors size their trades to re ect that option trades are riskier than stock trades and that option sales are riskier than option purchase. Speci cally, option purchases are $4,783 smaller than stock purchases when controlling for trader and date xed e ects, compared to the $6,178 di erence for all option trades. This suggests that retail traders adjust their position sizes based on the perceived risks. In summary, while options inherently o er higher leverage potential, the combination of smaller trade sizes and modest di erences in absolute dollar pro ts results in only modest realized leverage for retail option trades in our data. This nding challenges the common assumption that leverage is a primary motivation for retail option trading. 4.4 Preference for Positive Skewness Do retail investors utilize options for to seek positive skewness, often associated with gambling? Long option positions can yield a lottery-like payo , characterized by substantial potential pro ts and limited losses. If the primary motivation of investors is gambling, their trading dollar pro ts should display positive skewness. We perform two tests showing that option trades do not exhibit the positive dollar pro t skewness typically associated with gambling behavior. In our initial test, Table 8 evaluates the asymmetry in the distribution of dollar trade pro ts. The P&L distribution for stock trades is nearly symmetric. For instance, the 10th and 90th percentiles for stock purchases are -$109 and $91, respectively. This result also holds for more extreme percentiles and trade subsamples. Interestingly, the distribution for option trades is also nearly symmetric, or even slightly left-skewed. This pattern persists even when we restrict the sample to option purchases. For this subset, the 10th and 90th percentiles are -$296 and $217, respectively. If anything, the P&L distribution leans slightly to the left. This trend continues as we examine further into the tails of the distribution, comparing the 1st and 99th percentiles (-$3,502 and $2,523) or the 0.5th and 99.5th percentiles (-$6,915 and $5,051). The results are robust for the sample of non-back lled trades reported in the last panel of the table: the 10th and 90th percentiles are -$309 and $227. While investors are primarily concerned with dollar pro ts, we also investigate the skewness in option relative pro ts or returns. Table 8 shows that the 10th and 90th return percentiles for option purchases are -71% and 35%, respectively. Thus, at moderate percentiles, the option return distri- 18bution exhibits slight left-skewness, which does not support gambling preferences. However, option returns cannot fall below -100% for option purchases, which becomes binding for more extreme percentiles, resulting in positive skewness. For instance, the 1st and 99th return percentiles for op- tion purchases are -100% and 187%, respectively. The discrepancy between dollar and percentage results suggests that the distribution of trade size likely counterbalances the positive skewness in percentage returns. Larger trades tend to be associated with less skewed percentage returns. For example, large option trades held for a few hours would not result in signi cant positive skewness. In the second test, we compute realized skewness per trader separately for option and stock purchases as the adjusted Fisher{Pearson standardized moment coe\u000ecient. That is, for each in- vestor, we compute the realized skewness for option trade return and the realized skewness for stock trade returns. Thus, we get two skewness values per investor if the investor trades both stocks and options or one value if the investor only trades stocks or options. We then use a regression analysis to test for di erences in the skewness of stock and option trades.",

The left part of the panel shows that the percentage return skewness is higher for option trades than for stock trades, which is highly statistically signi cant. This result holds when we control for investor xed e ects. The right part of the panel, however, shows that the dollar return skewness of option and stock trades is not statistically di erent, and the di erence is economically small. Again, this result holds when we control for investor xed e ects. 4.5 Trader and 0DTE Subsamples To address potential sample bias and enhance the generalizability of our ndings, we conduct a comprehensive subgroup analysis. We evaluate how our main results vary across eight distinct trader subsamples, categorized by trading style, size, activity level, and instrument preference. We distinguish between day-traders and longer-horizon traders based on whether their median trade duration exceeds one day. To capture di erences in trading capacity, we separate large and small traders using a median trade size threshold of $200 and $5,000, respectively. We also di erentiate between active and inactive traders, using median monthly trade counts of less than 10 and more than 30. Finally, we contrast traders who specialize exclusively in options with those who trade both stocks and options. We pick the thresholds so that each subsample is su\u000eciently populated. 19Within each trader sample, we compute the key statistics characterizing our main results. The statistics include average price for stock trades, average underlying price for option trades (excluding index option trades), average fraction of trades in top 10 most popular stocks and options (among the traders' sample under consideration), median dollar return skewness for stock and option trades, and median of traders' average stock and option returns. For example, we compute average return for each trader and then take a median across all traders in a subsample. Table 10 shows that our main results are broadly robust across these trader subsamples. First, retail traders use options as an a ordable way to trade high-priced stocks. Within all the trader samples, average price for stock trades is much smaller than the underlying price for option trades. The smallest price gap is for multi-day traders with a $97.3 average stock price and a $307.2 average underlying price. Second, for all the trader samples, the option trading is concentrated in few underlying symbols, while stock trading is dispersed across many symbols. Top ten symbols typically account for 50-70% of all option trades. Multi-day traders are the exception with 33% of option trades in the top ten symbols, which is still much more concentrated than their stock trades (11%). Next, in all traders' samples, traders do not exhibit preference for positive skewness. The dollar P&L is slightly negatively skewed with similar magnitude for stock and option trades. For example, dollar return skewness for multi-day traders is -0.25 for stock trades and -0.14 for option trades. Finally, in terms of average trade return, small traders, who are presumably less sophisticated, lose the most per option trade (-3.4%). In contrast, multi-day traders lose only 0.9% per option trade and break even on their stock trades. There are growing concerns that the surge in 0DTE trading could potentially trigger market instability and even a stock market crash. We do not directly address these policy concerns but instead explore our main results for 0DTE trades, 23% of all option trades in our dataset. As suggested by option pricing theory, short-term options exhibit higher embedded leverage and have lower prices. Consequently, as Table IA.3 shows, the average trade size for 0DTE trades is much smaller, at $1,068, compared to $2,268 for the other trades. A vast majority of 0DTE trades (93.3%) start with an option purchase, while naked option sales are rare. As for the pro tability, 0DTE trades, on average, lose 4.6% per trade, whereas the other trades earn zero return. This result indicates that losses in retail options are predominantly concentrated in 0DTE options. Lastly, the underlying price for 0DTE trades is higher ($563 vs. $360, excluding S&P), consistent with retail 20investors preferring shorter-term options with lower prices to a ordably trade in high-priced stocks.",

Importantly, despite magnitude varia- tions, our main results remain robust across investor groups. 4.6 Complex Option Strategies Finally, we provide the rst look into how often retail investors employ \\complex\" option strate- gies. These strategies are important because about one third of all option trades (in OPRA) are quali ed as \\complex\" based on OPRA trade ags during our sample period (Li et al. (2023)). Undergraduate textbooks and practitioners emphasize that options can be used as lego block to construct customized payo pro les. But do retail investors use complex strategies? Speci cally, we consider ve types of popular complex strategies: call spread, put spread, volatility spread, covered call, and protective put. These strategies are covered extensively in textbooks and retail broker tutorials. If an investor buys a call and a put on the same stock on the same day, we label this trade as a volatility spread. Similarly, if an investor buy a call and sell a call with di erent strike prices on the same day, we label this trade as a call spread. Put spread is de ned similarly. For covered call and protective put, the account must trade the stock and the option on this stock on the same day. We likely overestimate the fraction of option-only strategies if, for instance, an investor buys a call in the morning, sells it by mid-day, and then buys a put in the afternoon. We currently classify complex trades using only trade date, which is available for all parent trades, but not trade intraday timestamps, which are available only for about half of traders. Finally, we could underestimate the fraction of covered call if the investors already owns the stock, but this assumption does not seem to be too restrictive given that most trades have a short horizon. We nd that retail investors are less likely to use complex strategies than the other investors. Table 11 reports descriptive statistics on complex strategies across accounts. The table reveals that multi-leg strategies are uncommon. Up to 16% of all option trades potentially qualify as complex trades, which is less frequent than one-in-three share of complex trades among all OPRA trades. Volatility spreads represent about 9.1% of all trades, while call and put spreads each represent about 3.3%. Covered calls and protective puts are even more rare. Even at 90th percentile across 21all accounts that trade options, covered calls and protective puts jointly account for about 0.3% of all option trades. Overall, while educational resources advertise complex strategies as an essential part of option trading toolbox, retail investors prefer simple strategies that involve trading one option at a time. 5 Validation and Comparison with Aggregate Retail Measures Due to the reluctance of brokers to disclose client trading data, previous studies on retail option trading have relied on aggregate proxies to identify certain option trades as likely being retail. For instance, Bryzgalova et al. (2022) utilize the \\single-leg auction\" ag for option trades in Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA, the analog of TAQ for options), which accounts for about one third of all OPRA trades. Notably, these trades are exclusively market orders that cross the spread and incur large trading costs. Alternatively, de Silva et al. (2023) employ the \\customer\" category of daily signed volume in the open-close data, which is self-reported by investors and could represent a range of investors from retail investors to professional hedge funds. About three quarters of all option trades are classi ed as customer trades. However, the exact percentage of the single-leg auction or customer trades that are genuinely retail remains an open question. Our trader-level data present several bene ts over the aggregate measures. We can directly observe retail trading, eliminating concerns about potential contamination by institutional trading. We observe the entire life-cycle of the trade from the position opening to its closing. Furthermore, our data include all orders, not just market orders as in the case of single-leg auctions, which a ects pro tability estimates.",

        "content": "Most crucially, we can examine the heterogeneity across investors and their interactions with stocks and options, an analysis that is not feasible with aggregate measures. The limitation of our data is that active retail traders are more likely to use a trading journal. Thus, our ndings should be extrapolated to the full universe of retail traders, which likely shows substantial heterogeneity, with caution. We conduct several tests to validate the retail nature of our data. First, the stock trade imbalance in our data set is positively correlated with popular measures of retail stock trading. We compute the stock trade imbalance as the di erence between the number of buy and sell parent trades, aggregated over a week or a month. Since retail trades in our data are sparse relative to 22the full stock-day cross-section, we require at least one trade to compute the imbalance measure. We also compute the imbalance at the weekly and monthly levels to alleviate sparsity concerns. We benchmark our imbalance measure against two popular measures of retail stock trading: the change in the number of Robinhood users holding a stock using the RobinTrack data (Barber et al. (2022); Eaton et al. (2022); Welch (2022)), and the retail trade imbalance in TAQ using the BJZZ algorithm (Boehmer et al. (2021)).14Availability of RobinTrack data limits the sample period for this test to January 2020 to August 2020. We contrast the retail imbalances with regular trade imbalance computed using the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm, which re ects all investor types. Table 12 reports regressions of the stock trade imbalance in our data set on the Robinhood popularity change, the BJZZ retail imbalance, and the Lee-Ready overall imbalance. We stan- dardize each variable within stock to make them comparable and include date xed e ects. In individual regressions in the rst three columns, each of these imbalance measures are positively and signi cantly correlated with the imbalance from our data. For example, a one standard devia- tion (within stock) increase in the Robinhood popularity corresponds to a 0.26 standard deviation increase in our weekly trade imbalance. Interestingly, once all three proxies are included in the joint regression, the Lee-Ready imbalance becomes statistically insigni cant while the BJZZ imbalance and Robinhood popularity remain strongly signi cant. This result shows that stock trade imbal- ance measured from our data set captures trading by retail investors rather than general investors. Reassuringly, weekly and monthly imbalances produce similar results. The results are also similar when the stock order imbalance includes the exit leg of each parent trade. The second validation test establishes a positive correlation between option trade volume in our data and the proxy for retail option volume proposed by Bryzgalova et al. (2022). They classify option trades agged as single-leg auction trades in OPRA as retail and share an aggregated retail option volume series by stock-day on their website. In order to isolate retail volume and mitigate the in uence of non-retail activity, we control for total option volume obtained from OPRA. Table 13 reports panel regressions of retail option trade count at the weekly or monthly fre- quencies on single-leg auction volume controlling for total option volume. Date xed e ects ac- commodate market-wide volume dynamics. As before, we standardize all variables within stock. 14Barber et al. (2022) and Battalio, Jennings, Saglam, and Wu (2023) evaluate the BJZZ measure and suggest improvements to the measure. 23Single-leg volume is positively associated with both call and put option trade volumes in our data, with all coe\u000ecients being statistically signi cant at least at the 10% level. For example, a one standard deviation (within stock) increase in weekly single-leg call volume is associated with a 0.17 standard deviation increase in retail call trade count in our data. The results hold at the monthly frequency for call volume but not for put volume. These results also validate 'single-leg' option volume as a measure of retail option trading. Finally, retail traders are attracted to zero commissions. Therefore, as a broker switches to zero commissions, retail participation is expected to increase. We con rm this hypothesis in a di erence-in-di erence test.",

We nd that a typical option trade involves a retail investor buying a one-day S&P 500 call and closing the position within an hour. Apart from documenting an anatomy of modern retail option trading, our paper conveys three main messages. Firstly, options have rapidly grown in popularity and rival stocks as the primary instrument for short- 15https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191001006211/en/The-Best-Just-Got-Better-TD-Ameritrade- Introduces-0-Commissions-for-Online-Stock-ETF-and-Option-Trades 24term speculation, with many investors switching to trading only options. Secondly, options play a unique role in retail trading and are not simply substitutes for stocks. For example, stock trades are concentrated in meme stocks, while option trades are concentrated in options linked to the S&P 500 index. Next, our ndings alleviate the concerns that retail traders predominantly gamble with options and incur substantial losses as a result. We nd that losses on option trades are relatively small, and the absence of positive realized leverage and skewness in trading pro ts suggests that gambling is not the main motive for option trading. Finally, investors are drawn to options as they o er an a ordable means to trade high-priced stocks. Overall, our results provide the rst portrait of a new generation of retail investors who actively engage in trade options. We leave it for future research to explore how short-term speculative trading in options can be understood through the lenses of behavioral nance theories. 25References Barber, B. M., X. Huang, T.

Trade descriptive statistics. This table reports descriptive statistics for the trades in our sample, which spans 1/2020 to 12/2022. Long (Short) is an indicator variable for long (short) trades. Index denotes trades in which the underlying is the S&P 500 or an ETF. Day trade takes the value one if a trade is closed on the same day as it is opened, and zero otherwise. 0DTE takes the value one if an option trade is on the same day as the option's expiration. Option moneyness is computed using the closing stock price on the day of the trade. Moneyness is winsorized at the levels of 5% and 95%. The main sample includes 1,525,497 stock trades and 889,967 option trades. For a random subsample of about half of all accounts, we observe parent trade size, price, and holding period (655,229 stock trades and 299,017 option trades).

This table examines multiple traders' subsamples: traders with a median trade duration lower or equal than one day ( \u00141 day), traders with a median trade duration greater than one day ( >1 day), traders with a median trade size less than $200, traders with a median trade size greater than $5,000, traders with a median number of trades per month lower than 10, traders with a median number of trades per month greater than 30, traders who trade both stocks and options (stock-option), and traders who only trade options (option-only). Within each trader sample, the table reports average price for stock trades, average underlying price for option trades, average fraction of trades in top 10 most traded stocks and options, median dollar return skewness for stock and option trades, and median of traders' average stock and option returns. For example, among traders with a trade horizon lower than one day, the median across traders' average return on option trades is -2.5%. The statistics for price, top 10 fraction, and average returns are computed for all traders in our data set, whereas the statistics for dollar skew require trade size and price that we observe for a subsample of all traders.

We evaluate contempor- ary trends, the opportunities arising from machine learning and the operational cost challenges faced, leveraging on the history of the industry to demonstrate why maintaining a competitive edge is paramount to its continued success. 1 What is Algorithmic Trading? Systematic trading (or algorithmic trading) refers to the automation of the trading process, through the creation of prede\ufb01ned rules (the \u2018trading system\u2019) and their strict application when executing \ufb01nancial market transactions. The automated trading system bene\ufb01ts from being repeatable and testable, unlike discretionary trading, which potentially has different rules for every transaction. Classical \ufb01nance theory such as the Ef\ufb01cient Market Hypothesis [1], suggests it is impossible to consistently beat the market without taking additional risk(s). Systematic traders attempt to do just that, using fundamental and technical analysis, and suggest this is how the markets actually become ef\ufb01cient. Such trading systems are predominantly employed by Hedge Funds, currently with USD 2.9 trillion of assets under management (AUM) [3], who create alternative investment portfolios uncorrelated with the market using leverage and shorting techniques. Similarly High Frequency Trading \ufb01rms use this method to make markets, seek liquidity rebates, market inef- \ufb01ciencies and arbitrage from investor bias, such as gambler\u2019s (mean reversion) and hot-hands (momentum) fallacies. Systematic trading potentially offers better market prediction, trade execution and risk manage- ment for investors. Furthermore, they remove human emotion, introduce discipline and rigour. However they do not necessarily remove human bias from the implementation of the trading rules themselves, as exempli\ufb01ed in 1998 with the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) with USD 500bn AUM when its unhedged investments in Russian Government Bonds defaulted [2]. 2 Machine Learning Opportunities The world is changing with major and rapid advancement in new technologies such as machine learning, arti\ufb01cial intelligence, big data, quantum and cloud computing, making the transfer of information faster, seamless and ef\ufb01cient. Human behaviour is evolving with these new technologies and heavily in\ufb02uenced by social media trends, which are rapidly accelerating the dissemination of information, fake news, pro- paganda and misinformation. Systems that can both process and cleanse the vast amounts of \ufb01nancial and alternative data from social media have a distinct edge over systems and discre- tionary traders that cannot and have the opportunity to generate superior returns. 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=34662133 Operational Cost Challenges The Operational costs required to maintain a competitive edge are a signi\ufb01cant challenge for the systematic trading industry. Systems need to evolve, be continually tested and optimised in an increasingly transient and evolving market to ensure they remain pro\ufb01table. Predatory systems seek to exploit inferior systems. Amaranth Investors epitomise this chal- lenge, despite having a pro\ufb01table system 14 out of 15 years, in 2006 they made losses of USD 6 billion in a fortnight as natural gas futures prices plunged and they were unable to liquidate their positions fast enough to meet their margin calls [4]. Increased competition, trading volumes and market sophistication with more informed coun- terparties is reducing bid-offer spreads and pro\ufb01t margins from market-making. Whilst the \ufb01xed cost maintaining an agile technology stack to keep pace with evolving markets is a major challenge. 4 Conclusion In conclusion the systematic trading industry is faced with the opportunity to bene\ufb01t from ma- chine learning and new technologies to generate superior returns. However increasing opera- tional, research and development costs present a persistent challenge.",

Bence Marton \u2013 bencemartonur@gmail.com Hasan Cakir \u2013 hasancakir92@gmail.com Master of Sceince in Financial Engineering - WorldQuant University (Capstone Project) Supervisor: Saad Zaman October 2022 Abstract The goal of this research paper is to build trend following strategies for intraday trading by using the Hurst Exponent and combining it with technical indic ators such as the SuperTrend indicators. First, we attempt to minimize the white noise effect of the Hurst Exponent using Kalman Filter . Going further, we will use the Hurst Exponent to identify trending and mean -reverting time series, based on this we will use the signals of the SuperTrend indicator to enter into position. We will use backtader.py for back testing on Index ETFs such as S PY and QQQ, on 60 minute, and daily timeframes. Keywords: Trading Strategies, Hurst Exponent, SuperTrend indicator, Day Trading, Trend following, Mean -Reversion, Kalman Filter, Fast Fourier Transform denoiser, Bollinger bands, Technical indicators Introduc tion There two main categories of trading strategies, trend following and mean -reverting. The main assumption of trend following strategy is that the trend will continue, either up or down and mean - reverting assumes that a time series will revert to its mean, so the price will return to its previous level. In order to be able to decide which strategy can be winning at the time the Hurst Exponent can be useful as it can indicate whether a ti me series or a share price trending, mean -reverting or follows random walk otherwise white noise. The Hurst Exponent measures the long -term memory of a time series. First it was discovered by H.E. Hurst while he was working on determining the right dam siz e for the river Nile, and he published his book in 1951 called \"Long -term storage capacity of reservoirs\". The Hurst Exponent ranges from 0 to 1, and in the range of 0.5 \u2013 1 indicates that there is a good chance in the series that high value will be follow ed by high value, in the range of 0 \u2013 0.5 a low value will be followed by low value and if the value is at 0.5 it means that the series are uncorrelated. In trading, we can say if the value is between 0.5 and 1, then the prices are trending, if the values are between 0 and 0.5 the prices are mean - reverting, and if the value is equal to 0.5 then the prices follow random walk, meaning the price movement cannot be predicted. In this research, we intend to reduce/remove white noise from time series (using mathe matical models). Identify trending markets using the Hurst Exponent and take buy or sell signals using technical indica tors such as the SuperTrend indicator in order to generate alpha. The SuperTrend indicator is a trend following indicator displayed on a chart and if the price is above the lower band the trend is bullish if the price is below the upper band the trend is bearish. It has two parameters the period and the multiplier; these are calculated using the average true range or ATR indicator. The peri od indicates the time period employed for the ATR and the value of the multiplier is multiplied by the ATR. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42907872 Data & Development Environment The strategy development was done in python environment, to backtest the strategies backtrader.py (https://www.backtrader.com/ ) was utilized, as it is a python library which allows us to focus on writing reusable trading strategies, indicators and analyzers instead of having to spend time building infrastructure . Backtrader is an event driven backtest framework, which means that different parts of code (strategies, indicators, analyzers etc.) communicate continuously with each other by emitting and consuming events that represent some change in state. Thanks to event driven arch itecture, we were able to implement realistic scenarios about how order will be executed, and those scenarios were easily configurable. Secondly, it was easy to avoid look -ahead bias because market data receipt is treated as an \"event\" that must be acted up on.",

        "content": "[10] Historical prices were download from AmeriTrade is brokerage firm located in US and they are providing historical data for almost all equities in US Stock Exchange market in different timeframes. Therefore, AmeriTrade API is utilized to download hi storical data for our chosen ETFs, namely SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust) & QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust) . We downloaded 60 minute and daily price data of SPY & QQQ from June of 2021 till October 2022 and from 2019 till 2022 October respectively. With the daily price data, we wanted to illustrate trading environment during the Covid crash, to see how our system performs under different market conditions. Furthermore, i n order to consider realistic trading scenarios, buy and sell signals are execut ed on the next bar at market price on the best bid/ask available, also broker commissions are included in the final results. During development, we firstly focused developing the methods to download historical data, thanks to those methods we can download historical price data of an equity in different time frames and periods. Secondly, we developed an abstract base strategy class which allows defining generic methods like stop loss, logs, trade notification etc., that can be used in any strategy. Then, we developed our main strategy class which is derived from base strategy class. The strategy includes the method for the indicators (HE and SuperTrend) and for buy/sell signal logic. It is a configurable strategy which accepts different parameters; thus, we had an opportunity to backtest different scenarios easily by sending different variables to the strategy. Finally, we setup Backtrader engine to run backtest different strategies for our ETFs, engine accepts price data, filtered price data and strategy as inputs and returns backtest results (profit rate, strike rate, PnL, max drawdown and sharpe ratio). Also, it shows a graphical representation of our trading on price data. Reducing White Noise Basically if a time series has white noise then it`s not predi ctable otherwise follows random walk. White noise has three conditions, which are the mean has to be zero, the standard deviation of time series has to be constant, so no change in the value, and the correlation between time series and its lagged version i sn`t significant. Whether a time series has white noise it can be tested checking for autocorrelation using ACF plots in python and studying the autocorrelation plots. As explained earlier, The Hurst Exponent also shows if a time series has white noise whe n its value is around 0.5. For any kind of trading strategy one of the obstacles is to reduce the impact of white noise on indicators that are used to measure either trending or mean -reverting behavior. The fa ilure to do so results in poor trading results due to false signals , and these kinds of false signals most probably will result in trading loss. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize the white noise effect. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42907873 There two techniques which can reduce white noise in a time series namely Fast Fourier Transform denoiser and Kalman filter. The Fast Fourier Transform or FFT can filter out the noise and it does this by moving time series from time domain to frequency domain, and after applying the inverse Fourier transform, we get a filtered time series . FFT filters the noise at di fferent levels of n_components, the higher this value is, more frequencies are remove d. As with most techniques it is very important to find the right parameters, in this case a parameter which keeps the trend but removes the noise. The disadvantage of the FFT is that we do not know when the frequencies happen in our time, so this method is not the best for non -stationary time series. In our research we used 2400 for n_components and although it seems filtering the data improved our final re turn but also because we rather over fitted the data. Therefore, we decided to go with Kalman filter and implement it in our trading strategy. Of course, it is also important to select the right parameters for this technique, so we tune the algorithm to br ing out the underlying signal .",

        "content": "Kalman filter can correctly estimate hidden states using its observable variables . In order to implement our Kalman filtered modelling technique we use the pykalman .py library. As parameters are key for this model, we use variance 1 and an initial guess for the mean is 0. One of the advantages of the Kalman filter is that it realizes our initial guess and adjusts these quickly. Furthermore, window length does not needed to be selected, thus there is less chance for overfitting. In order to test the Fast Fourier Transform , we calculate the Hurst values using the filtered prices by the FFT on hourly and daily SPY data, as well as on the original price data for the same periods and the results are plotted on the same ch art for comparison. On Figure 1, using Daily chart prices, eventually FFT does a good job filtering out noise from our SPY series, the filtered prices are much smoother compared to the original data as there are no big swings in the filtered data. On the other hand, the Hurst values calculated from the filtered p rices are do not provide useful information whether our time series are trending or mean -reverting compared to the Hurst values calculated based on the original SPY data. As it can be seen on Figure 1, there are several trending periods in the series, howe ver the FFT data Hurst values are never go beyond 0.5, and most of the time these values are below 0.4 and even approaching 0 when the market crashed during the first Covid lockdown in early 2020. While the Hurst values from the original SPY data are correc tly showing when the market is trending (H > 0.5) or mean -reverting (H < 0.5). Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42907874 Figure 1 . Comparison between Daily SPY and FFT filtered SPY prices and their Hurst values As it can be seen on Figure 2. below, on shorter time frames, on Hourly data, the Hurst values from FFT filtered prices are incorrect as they go below 0 into minus territory, thus these values do no provide useful readings, while again the Hurst values calculated from the original SPY price a re showing when the market is trending or not. As mentioned earlier, the Fast Fourier Transform denoiser is not a reliable technique to minimize the white noise in time series as our research shows that it can be over fitted easily and not useful for trend ing or non -stationary time series. Therefo re, we decided to use Kalman filter technique and implement it in our strategies. For testing the effectiveness of this technique, the Hurst values are calculated on daily and hourly chart data, on both the Kalman filtered and original prices and plotted on the same graphs for comparison, which we will illustrate below Figure 3. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42907875 Figure 2. Comparison between Hourly SPY and FFT filtered SPY prices and their Hurst values As, we can see it on the below on the Daily ch art Kalman filter does a better job on filtering out the noise from our SPY series compared to the FFT technique. First of all, there are much less swings in the Kalman filtered prices compared to the original SPY prices, which means less noise, and if we compare Figure 1 and Figure 3, there are bigger swings in the FFT filtered prices compared to the Kalman filtered prices. Eventually, being able to filter out the noise from time series can utilize the Supertrend indicator to provide more accurate and reli able signals as one of the backbones of this indicator is the Average True Range volatility indicator. Furthermore, on the Hurst values, the Kalman filer provides real values compared to the FFT technique, and as we can see on Figure 3 the Kalam filtered Hurst values react to the prices changes more rapidly compared to the Hurst values calculated on the original prices. On the other, the Kalman filtered Hurst values do not always provide correct reading whether the SPY series trending or not.",

        "content": "For example, when the market crashed during the first Covid lockdown early 2020, the Kalman filtered Hurst values are showing that our series is mean -reverting when H < 0 .5, while the price was clearly trending lower. Also, when the market turned in early May of 2020, the Hurst values calculated from the original SPY data are showing us a trending market H > 0.5, however the Kalman filtered Hurst values only go above 0.5 in mid -August of 2020 and showing us that the market is trending, so basically despite Kalman filtered Hurst values react rapidly to the price changes, which would be useful to know earlier when a time series start or stop trending, yet it seems lagging behind the Hurst values calculated from the original prices . As our research is foc using on short term trading, we will examine if the same observation is true on hourly chart prices on Figure 4. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42907876 Figure 3 . Comparison between Daily SPY and Kalman filtered SPY prices and their Hurst values Figure 4 . Comparison between Hourly SPY and Kalman filtered SPY prices and their Hurst values Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42907877 As Figure 4 shows Hourly SPY prices above, the Kalman filtered prices are smoother compared to the original SPY prices, and Kalman filtered prices showing less swings in the price, however even though this technique does a good job reducing the noise in our series , again the Kalman filtered Hurst values are lagging behind the Hurst values calculated from the original prices, just like on the Daily chart. For example, we can see that Hurst values calculated from the original prices are already showing trending series H > 0.5 from early October of 2021, while the Kalman filtered Hurst values only start showing from early November of 2021 that our series is in trend H > 0. Based on, these data and chart we can not conclude that reducing white noise in a time series helps improving the values of the Hurst Exponent. Trading Strategies The initial idea to utilize the Hurst Exponent and its effectiveness in trading was to combine with a trend following indicator we choose SuperTrend as trough our observations it seemed to provide profitable trading signals in trending market environment, however it also provides a lot of false signals when the market is moving in a thigh range otherwise time series showing mean -reverting behavior. Obviously as the Hurst Exponent can identify which market we are in at the time, it seemed logical to combine the two and possibly limit the false signals of the SuperTrend indicator. So, the buy and signals is defined by SuperTrend level: \uf0b7 If price is crossing over SuperTrend level, it is a buy signal. \uf0b7 If price is crossing down SuperTrend level, it is a sell signal. However, the general idea is that only enter the market if the Hurst Exponent is above 0.5. Moreover, we have implemented optional and configurable Hurst Exponent logic and white noise reduction logic. Those optional logics give us an opportunity t o apply backtesting different combination of strategies easily. We have two parameters as apply_hurst_exponent and apply_noise_reduction to identify if we apply HE or white noise reduction. Applying HE If we apply HE, we are extending SuperTrend signal b y checking if HE is smaller than 0.5 which means that the data is not trend following. So, we are not executing any buy/sell signal while the data is not trend following. Applying White Noise Reduction We are feeding SuperTrend strategy with two different data sources as filtered ETF price data (filtered by Kalman Filtering) and original ETF price data. If we apply noise reduction, we are using filtered data to build our HE and SuperTrend Indicator. Then, we are defining buy and sell signal as following : \uf0b7 If filtered data price is crossing over SuperTrend level, it is a buy signal. \uf0b7 If filtered price is crossing down SuperTrend level, it is a sell signal. On the other hand, we are executing trade transaction by using original data.

Between the two short term strategies, Strategy 1 performed better in terms of return, however , we like Strategy 2 better as it has very high 5.91 Sharp Ratio and its win/loss rat io is also better compared to Strategy 1. Based on these numbers, we conclude that our base strategy performs better in terms of return on a relatively volatile ETF and eventually filtering signal by the Hurst Exponent increases our return , on the other hand it increases our risk as well. Eventually, trading on a less volatile ETF like SPY provides much higher Sharp Ratio. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=429078712 Conclusions This research project explores the effectiveness of the Hurst Exponent by reducing white noise and its profitability combi ned with a trend following indicator. Based on our research and backtesting several combinations of the parameters, we found that using our Kalman filter technique to reduce white noise in a time series does not necessarily improve the signals and the effe ctiveness of the HE and SuperTrend indicator, as the backtesting results with applying noise reduction did not provide superior returns. On the other hand, using HE and SuperTrend indicators, we managed to create a profitable alpha generating trading short term trading strategy, which seems works better on hourly time frame, compared to 1 or 5 minute and daily time frames as we have also backtested our base strategy on minute time frames, however the results were not profitable. Of course, we must mention t hat the research was limited due to the lack of free availably of historical data. Our d eveloped Kalman filter modeling technique to minimize effect of white noise indeed reduces the noise in a time series; however, it did not improve the signals of the Hu rst Exponent. With that we believe our base strategy combining the Hurst Exponent and SuperTrend indicators can generate alpha during volatile market conditions. Reference 1. Backtrader . (n.d.).

While the benefits and pitfalls of mean return and volatility forecasts are well-studied in the literature, trading costs have received relatively little attention, and forecasting trading costs has received no attention.2 Predicting trading costs, particularly at the individual stock level, is challenging since the biggest component of these costs for a large investor is price impact, which depends on the size of the trade and the amount traded by other traders in that security, as well as the identity of the trader (Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz, 2018).3Since each trader may face their own cost function, finding a generic solution to this piece of the portfolio problem is challenging. Moreover, the size of the trade is endogenously a function of expected trading costs, finding an estimate of expected costs is critical to the portfolio decision. To circumvent these issues, we take a unique approach to predicting stock-specific expected trading costs by focusing on the component of costs that is neither trader-specific nor endogenous \u2013 the level of total trading volume in the stock. Trading volume is driven by other traders in the market for the same security, which is generic to all traders. As Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz (2018) show, trade size divided by daily trading volume \u2013 termed the market participation rate in a stock \u2013 is the key driver of price impact costs. Following Kyle (1985), price impact is an increasing function of participation rate. Holding trade size constant, the less trading volume in the stock the greater the trader\u2019s price impact will be.4Our empirical strategy is to forecast trading volume for 1A very long literature in asset pricing focuses on return prediction, with summaries on the state of this literature, including some of its criticisms, found in Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016); McLean and Pontiff (2016); Jensen, Kelly, and Pedersen (2022). A good summary of the literature on volatility prediction can be found in Engle (2004). 2Several papers focus on trading costs from a theoretical perspective: Kyle (1985); G\u02c6 arleanu and Pedersen (2016). Even less work has provided empirical estimates of trading costs for use in a portfolio optimization context: Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz (2012, 2018). 3While many different trading cost models exist, they universally contain these three elements: trade size, market size, and trader specifics (identify, information, motive, patience, etc.).",

        "content": "4Theoretical foundations of trading costs in the classic market microstructure literature include asymmetric infor- mation (Kyle, 1985; Glosten and Milgrom, 1985) and inventory costs (Stoll, 1978; Ho and Stoll, 1983; Grossman and Miller, 1988). In either case, volume is the major determinant of liquidity (Benston and Hagerman, 1974; Glosten and Harris, 1988; Brennan and Subrahmanyam, 1995) and is used to proxy for trading costs or liquidity (Campbell, Grossman, and Wang, 1993; Datar, Naik, and Radcliffe, 1998; Amihud, 2002). 2each security as a proxy for expected trading costs, and then use this forecast to optimize portfolios net of those costs and quantify its benefits. Importantly, our aim is to provide a general forecast of costs for an individual stock that abstracts from the need to specify trade size and applies universally across all traders. Our goal isnot to provide the \u201cbest\u201d or most reliable trading cost model or forecast. Rather, our simple objective is to provide a forecast of trading costs that any trader could use. This aim necessitates a simple, rather than sophisticated, trading cost model. The goal is to focus on one component of a trading cost model that is generic and see how valuable that can be. To quantify the economic magnitude of volume prediction, we incorporate volume prediction into a portfolio theory problem. We model a portfolio framework that seeks to maximize the net-of-cost performance of the portfolio using a mean-variance utility function, where the cost of transacting scales linearly with participation rate (motivated by theory and empirical work from the literature). The optimization trades off the cost of trading versus the (opportunity) cost of not trading \u2013 minimizing trading costs versus minimizing tracking error to the before-cost optimal portfolio \u2013 where trading costs and tracking error are endogenously negatively related. In the model, we take the first and second moments of security returns as given and focus solely on the tradeoff between trading costs and tracking error to the pre-cost optimal portfolio. Using this framework, we can couch the volume prediction problem into a portfolio problem and quantify the economic value of volume prediction in terms of its benefit to after-cost returns or Sharpe ratio.5In essence, we translate trading volume predictability into portfolio alpha, which we term \u201ctrading volume alpha.\u201d This translation opens up after-cost portfolio modeling, which has been restricted due to limited access to trading cost data, to the widely available volume data. This paper demonstrates the economic value of volume prediction with one set of predictors and standard neural network implementation. Yet the framework laid out in the paper illustrates the importance of and enables more work on constructing volume prediction signals and models.6 We impose a functional form for trading costs due to price impact motivated by theory (Kyle, 5Related, Balduzzi and Lynch (1999) and C \u00b8 etin, Jarrow, and Protter (2004) model transaction costs in portfolio settings and study the economic value in various transaction cost models. 6This research answers the call to integrate market microstructure frictions into asset pricing studies using machine learning tools (Goldstein, Spatt, and Ye, 2021). 31985) and empirical evidence (Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz, 2018), where price impact (Kyle\u2019s Lambda) is an increasing linear function of the trader\u2019s participation rate. All else equal, a higher predicted volume allows the trader to trade more aggressively (larger size) because price impact per dollar traded will be lower. Conversely, a lower predicted volume causes the trader to scale back the trade (even perhaps to zero and not trade) because the price impact per dollar will be higher. By modeling trading costs and benefits as a tracking error problem, we abstract from return or variance prediction and focus exclusively on volume prediction and its economic impact through expected trading costs. An interesting feature emerges from the model that generates an asymmetry in the economic value of volume prediction. Price impact costs are linear in participation rate, but non-linear in trading volume. Very low trading volume implies exponentially high impact costs, whereas very high volume implies negligible costs. As volume tends to zero, price impact costs approach infinity, whereas when volume becomes large, impact costs are bounded by zero.",

        "content": "Hence, predicted changes in volume have much more economic impact when volume is low versus high, thus creating asymmetric costs of volume forecast errors. Conversely, tracking error, or the opportunity cost of not trading, is independent of volume. The combination of these two effects implies the optimization will penalize overestimating volume more than underestimating volume. Trading too much when you overestimate volume is more costly than trading too little when you underestimate it. At lower volume, the cost of trading with respect to volume is very steep, and at high volume the cost-volume relationship is flat. Intuitively, an illiquid stock\u2019s price impact is very sensitive to small changes in volume and in a highly non-linear way \u2013 participation rates move by orders of magnitude for small changes in volume \u2013 resulting in trading costs increasing at a much faster rate when trading too aggressively. Conversely, a very liquid security\u2019s price is fairly inelastic to changes in volume, because having more or less liquidity at that point has little impact on costs. As a result, the optimization seeks to be conservative, rather than aggressive.7 Since participation rate drives trading costs, it is not only trading volume that matters, but also 7Our framework, and its implication that portfolio optimization will seek to trade conservatively rather than aggressively because of the asymmetric cost of volume forecast errors, implies that arbitrage activity may be limited as a consequence. This implication provides a novel and additional source of limits to arbitrage activity in the spirit of Shleifer and Vishny (1997). 4the size of the trade. Trade size is determined endogenously and is a function of expected trading volume and aversion to tracking error. In the model, the size (assets under management, AUM) and volatility of the fund (and risk aversion of the investor) also affect the costs and benefits of trading. Because price impact is an increasing function of participation rate, trading costs increase with AUM endogenously, and the relative penalty for tracking error decreases with AUM. The optimal tradeoff between trading costs and tracking error will therefore vary with the size of the portfolio, and so will the economic impact of volume prediction. For small AUM, tracking error considerations likely dominate trading cost considerations, hence the economic benefit to predicting volume may be relatively less valuable. For large AUM, trading cost considerations likely dominate.8 Applying the model framework to data, we run a series of trading experiments for optimally designed portfolios that take into account trading costs using stock-level volume prediction as the sole input. Since liquidity is an unknown quantity to the portfolio manager, she uses volume prediction as an input to alter the expected cost and benefit of trading, endogenously responding to her forecast of volume by altering her portfolio. We assess the out-of-sample performance of this portfolio, net of trading costs, to evaluate the economic impact of predicting volume. More accurate volume predictions provide more efficient implementation and hence more efficient portfolios net of costs. We experiment with various sets of target positions to mimic realistic trading tasks. We start by simulating an extremely profitable ( before-cost ) daily quantitative trading strategy, which represents an unachievable target. This portfolio, which requires high turnover and aggressive trading, is much less profitable after accounting for trading costs. We then consider expected trading costs in the optimization to maximize the after-cost performance of the fund (at various fund sizes). We also target a host of factor portfolios from Jensen, Kelly, and Pedersen (2022) that are based on ex-ante return-predicting characteristics to examine the effectiveness of trading volume alpha across the spectrum of factors. We examine the net of trading cost performance of an investment strategy that seeks to target each of these factor portfolios while taking expected trading costs into account, 8From this analysis, it is also possible to assess the optimal dollar size of the portfolio, including the break-even fund size where trading costs exactly offset portfolio returns or the fund size that maximizes after-cost dollars rather than returns (Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz, 2018). 5using predicted market trading volume as the only input into forecasting expected trading costs.",

        "content": "Expected trading costs dictate how frequently to trade, which stocks to trade, and how much to trade, with each of these choices simultaneously affecting tracking error to the portfolio. We find that volume prediction has a measurable and significant effect on after-cost portfolio performance. To predict volume, we use technical signals, such as lagged returns and lagged trading volume, as well as firm characteristics that the literature finds capture return anomalies, but not necessarily trading volume. We then add indicators for various market-wide or firm-level events associated with volume fluctuation, including upcoming and past earnings releases. We analyze both linear and non-linear prediction methods using various neural networks designed to maximize out-of-sample predictability. Finally, we alter the objective/loss function of the neural network to take into account the portfolio problem\u2019s economic objective when predicting volume. Our aim, again, is not to find the best prediction model for stock trading volume, but rather to couch the prediction problem into economic outcomes and measure its costs and benefits accordingly. To that end, we assess a number of different models and variables for predicting volume in order to highlight how different prediction methods lead to different economic consequences.9 We find that volume prediction improves significantly over moving averages of lagged trading volume when using technical signals. Adding firm characteristics (such as BE/ME) further im- proves volume predictability, even though these variables are primarily used for return forecasting and are not necessarily related to trading volume. Information on events such as earnings releases further enhances volume predictability. Non-linear functions from neural network searches provide better predictability over simple linear models, controlling for the same set of variables/information. Recurrent neural networks, which learn dynamic predictive relationships, yield additional improve- ments. Finally, we find that imposing an economic loss function consistent with the portfolio prob- lem greatly improves the value of volume predictability from a portfolio performance perspective. Specifically, we fine-tune the neural networks on the economic objective (derived from the portfolio problem) rather than on a statistical objective, such as mean squared errors used to pre-train the 9For example, we leave out many potential variables that relate to trading volume, such as other microstructure variables, cross-security lead-lag effects, etc. 6volume prediction model. Fine-tuning yields significant gains in out-of-sample portfolio perfor- mance compared to the statistically pre-trained model. This result obtains because the portfolio problem recognizes that trading costs are not a linear function of trading volume. The neural network places greater weight on observations that impact trading costs more and worries less about predicting volume where trading costs are less affected, such as recognizing the asymmetric costs of over- versus underestimating volume. While an MSE objective criterion may maximize the out-of-sample R2of volume prediction, an economic loss function directly tied to the portfolio problem provides more valuable volume predictability that results in better out-of-sample after-cost portfolio performance. Since portfolio size affects the tradeoff between the cost and benefit of trading, the resulting portfolio solution also changes with different levels of AUM. In addition, while volume prediction has benefits across all factors, some factors have a greater trading volume alpha than others due to the varying tradeoff between the cost of trading and the opportunity cost of not trading. Intuitively, we find that factors with a higher turnover (e.g., momentum, short-term reversals) benefit more from portfolio optimization that accounts for expected trading costs based on volume forecasts. In general, we find that trading volume alpha is substantial. The marginal improvement on a portfolio from trading volume alpha is as large as finding return alpha. For example, for a $1 billion fund, the after-cost improvement in portfolio performance due solely to trading volume prediction beyond using lagged volume measures, can be as much as double in terms of expected returns or Sharpe ratio after trading costs. Among popular asset pricing factors, the improvement in after-cost returns ranges from 20 bps to 100 bps above using a moving average of lagged volume to predict future volume. Refining the prediction methods and deepening the prediction models could add substantially to these improvements, generating even larger trading volume alpha.

        "content": "Section 2 covers some preliminaries to the analysis: a motivation for predicting trading volume and a description of our data. Section 3 examines volume prediction from a purely statistical perspective to maximize out-of-sample predictability. Section 4 presents a theoretical optimal portfolio framework for quantifying the economic value of volume prediction in terms of portfolio performance, which we call \u201ctrading volume alpha.\u201d Section 5 7discusses the empirical results of predicting volume through the lens of our theoretical framework using a variety of machine learning methods. Section 6 applies these insights and methods to trading experiments that characterize the net of cost performance improvement of simulated real- world portfolios. Section 7 concludes. 2 Preliminaries: Motivation and Data We first motivate why predicting volume is interesting and useful and then describe the data. 2.1 Motivation Trading costs are critical to realizing investment performance, yet insufficient empirical attention has been paid to them regarding optimal portfolio construction. This lack of research is largely due to the challenges imposed by modeling trading costs and finding a generic portfolio solution. As a consequence, and despite its importance, portfolio theory mainly focuses on modeling and forecasting the first and second moment of returns gross of costs. One of the main challenges in modeling and forecasting trading costs is that the largest com- ponent of these costs for a large investor is price impact, which depends on the size of the trade, the amount traded by other traders (in the same and in opposite directions), and the identity of the trader \u2013 different traders may face different price impacts. These features frustrate a generic portfolio solution that incorporates trading costs. In particular, since optimal portfolio weights should reflect the expected net of cost return, a solution requires an expected cost function, which varies by investor, and hence so will the portfolio solution. Following Kyle (1985) and subsequent empirical work (Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz, 2018), price impact depends on the trader\u2019s participation rate, defined as the dollar amount traded by investor nin security irelative to total dollar volume in stock i(the amount traded in the market by everybody in security i) at the same time t, ParticipationRate n,i,t=$Traded n,i,t $V olume i,t. 8Price impact is an increasing function of participation rate (modeled linearly in Kyle, 1985 and the positive relation empirically verified in Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz, 2018), whose elasticity varies by investor n. The numerator is also endogenous to expected price impact, which itself is a function of the participation rate. The circular nature of trade size, and its variation across investors, makes modeling trading costs particularly challenging. However, the denominator of the participation rate is independent of nand exogenous to the trader\u2019s desired trade size (assuming a single investor\u2019s trade is too small to materially affect total dollar volume). Thus, trading volume is generic and exogenous to each trader and provides a variable universal to all investors for modeling costs. From a prediction standpoint, total dollar volume is also easier to forecast than a specific investor\u2019s trades. Predicting market-level trading activity (total buys and sells) is an easier task and high frequency data on total trading volume is readily available, while data on individual traders is not. Moreover, as we will find, machine learning techniques can significantly improve our ability to forecast volume, due in part to the non-linear nature of volume and its relation to trading costs. With these insights, we model expected trading costs solely using forecasted total dollar volume for a stock. Although this exercise is only a partial solution to the trading cost problem, it is a general one, and it allows us to showcase the economic value of predicting trading volume in an optimal portfolio framework.10 2.2 Data We compile a data panel of daily stock-level dollar trading volume ( eVi,t) and 175 predictors ( Xi,t). The unit of observation is stock-day ( i, t). We adopt the convention that Xi,tis observed by day t\u22121, whereas the associated prediction target eVi,tis observed until the end of day t. We use a tilde to denote a random variable conditional on the information before day t. The sample period is 2018 to 2022, or 1,258 days.",

We tackle the forecasting problem given uncertain transaction costs and apply it within a portfolio optimization framework. 9a 3-year training sample and a 2-year testing sample. All models are trained once in the training sample and evaluated out of the sample. We avoid re-sampling methods such as cross-validation and rolling-window re-estimations. Our analysis focuses on predicting out-of-sample trading volume. Reasonable in-sample fit, often evaluated in the literature (Chordia, Huh, and Subrahmanyam, 2007; Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam, 2011), does not often lead to good out-of-sample (OOS) performance, which is of primary interest to evaluate the robustness and economic impact of volume predictability. While it is common in the stock return predictability literature to use large sets of variables (e.g., \u201cfactor zoo\u201d) to identify the best predictors, it is less common to use large data sets to predict market microstructure variables such as trading volume. We show that using big data improves the precision of volume forecasts significantly. The main variable we aim to predict is dollar trading volume, which we measure as the natural logarithm of end-of-day transacted total dollar trading volume for each stock. This variable is highly persistent. We focus on predicting innovations in trading volume as well, which we show has significant impact on trading costs. When volume is suddenly much lower than expected, an investor will \u201coverpay\u201d in transaction costs. If volume is higher than expected, then there is more liquidity, and an investor incurs opportunity costs from not trading aggressively enough. We examine the predictive content of several sets of predictors, including technical, fundamental, and event-based variables, which we describe below. 2.3 Prediction objects: daily stock trading volume Daily dollar trading volume eVi,tranges widely (from thousands to billions of dollars) across stocks and is highly skewed. We take the log of dollar volume, ev= logeV, whose distribution, shown in Figure 1, is relatively well-behaved, being close to normal and symmetrical. Log dollar volume is highly persistent in the time series and cross-section of stocks, and can be easily predicted by lagged moving averages of various frequencies. The five-day moving average predicts log dollar volume with an R2of 93 .68%, higher than the one-day lag (92 .53%), moving average of 22 days (92 .60%), or 252 days (86 .12%). 10Figure 1: Distributions of daily stock-level log dollar volume ( ev) and its shock ( e\u03b7), panel pooled Histograms of evi,tande\u03b7i,tin the full sample of around 4,400,000 stock-day observations.

Log dollar volume shock e\u03b7is daily log dollar volume minus the moving average in the past five days: e\u03b7i,t:=evi,t\u22121 5(evi,t\u22121+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+evi,t\u22125). We focus on predicting the log dollar volume shock defined as daily log dollar volume minus the moving average in the past five days, e\u03b7i,t:=evi,t\u22121 5(evi,t\u22121+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+evi,t\u22125) :=evi,t\u2212[ma 5]i,t. This exercise is comparable to predicting asset returns (change in log price) instead of price levels. Figure 1 (right panel) shows the pooled distribution of e\u03b7, which is relatively symmetric, centered around zero, and has long tails. 2.4 Predictors We use a total of 175 predictors from various sources, including technical signals, firm fundamentals, and market and corporate events. We show that the virtue of complexity approach in return prediction (Kelly, Malamud, and Zhou, 2024) is also useful for volume prediction. We find that each subset of variables provides incremental improvement to predicting volume, while using all variables has the greatest OOS predictability. We list the sets of predictors that are cumulatively added to the prediction model. 1. Technical signals (\u201ctech\u201d): lagged moving averages of returns and log dollar volume over the past 1, 5, 22, and 252 days. (8 predictors.) 2.

Calendar dates with large effects on trading volume (\u201ccalendar\u201d). We hard code four binary features based on the dates of the following four types of events. - Early closing days for the exchanges (July 3rd, Black Friday, Christmas Eve, and New Year\u2019s Eve). - Triple witching days (four times a year when the index futures contract expires at the same time as the index option contract and single stocks options). - Double witching days (eight times a year when two of the three events above, the single stock options and index options expiration, coincide). - Russell index re-balancing (once a year, the fourth Friday in June).12 Early closing days have substantially less trading volume, while the other three are associated with positive spikes in trading volume. 5. Earnings release schedule (\u201cearnings\u201d): We construct 10 categorical dummy variables (one- hot encoding) indicating whether the firm has an upcoming earnings release or just had one in the past few days. We first construct the number of days until the next known scheduled earnings release event. For example, a value of zero implies the current day is previously known to have a scheduled release. A negative value means there are no known scheduled events in the future and indicates how many days since the last event. We convert this number into 10 dummy variables of categorical bins: \u2264 \u22124,\u22123,\u22122,\u22121,0,1,2,3,4,\u22655. The data source is the Capital IQ Key Developments dataset. (10 predictors.) This list of variables for predicting volume is not exhaustive. Other variables that could add 11These predictors are from the JKP dataset (Jensen, Kelly, and Pedersen, 2022). We forward fill the monthly firm characteristics in time when merging to the daily panel. Hence, the characteristics are still always ex-ante available. On each day, we rank standardize in the cross-section each characteristic to a uniform distribution from -1 to +1. 12Triple witching happens on the third Friday in March, June, September, and December. Double witching is on the third Friday in the other eight months. Russell index re-balancing is on the fourth Friday of June when the Russell 1000, Russell 2000, Russell 3000, and other Russell indexes are reconstituted, and has \u201coften been one of the highest- volume trading days of the year\u201d for the exchange, due to indexes tracking funds adjusting their holdings to reflect the updates.

As stated previously, we do not attempt to provide the best volume prediction model. Rather, we translate the volume prediction problem into an economic problem whose objective is after-cost portolio performance. Using our framework, future work can add further predictors for volume that may provide even larger economic benefits than we show here. However, our framework provides a way to assess those predictive contributions in economic terms. 3 Volume prediction from a statistical perspective We start with a statistical prediction of daily trading volume using various subsets of predictors and a variety of methods, including machine learning techniques. 3.1 Prediction methods We run predictive regressions of e\u03b7(changes in daily dollar volume) on a set of predictors, X, in the training sample panel to estimate the models.13We compare linear models (ols), with neural networks (nn) that allow for non-linear transformations and complex interactions, as well as recurrent neural networks (rnn) that, in addition, allow for state variables to incorporate time series dynamics. The simplest baseline is predicting bvi,t= [ma 5]i,t, or in other words, b\u03b7i,t= 0. (The \u201chat\u201d denotes predicted values.) Linear regression is also a simple benchmark comparison. The neural network implementation is kept simple, standard, and fixed throughout the paper in order to facilitate transparency. The network architecture has three fully-connected hidden layers of 32, 16, and 8 ReLU nodes, respectively, and one linear output node. The size of the input layer is the number of predictors supplied. Recurrent neural network architecture is particularly appealing for this application as it is designed to capture time-series dynamics.",

From the machine learning perspective, this is implementing a simple residual connection (ResNet, He et al. 2016) as illustrated in Figure 4. 13also of a set of state variables that is the output of the network applied to the previous data point {i, t\u22121}. That is, ( b\u03b7i,t, state i,t) =rnn(Xi,t, state i,t\u22121), where rnn represents the neural network function and state are the state variables. The recurrent neural network processes data sequentially, and recursively passes the state variables to the next time period. Essentially, rnn extracts predictive information from concurrent and lagged predictors Xi,t, Xi,t\u22121, Xi,t\u22122, . . ., in contrast to a nn that uses only the concurrent predictors but nothing from the past. Although Xi,t contains moving averages of evi,t\u22121,evi,t\u22122,evi,t\u22123. . ., for example, the way such lagged information enters the model without an rnn architecture is highly restrictive. With rnn, the model can \u201clearn\u201d flexible dynamics, where time-series dependencies are parameterized by trainable network weights. We implement the rnn with the popular and standard lstm (long short-term memory) architecture. The number of layers and neurons are kept the same as nn, but the total number of parameters increases by four times (due to the flow of lagged information).14 Appendix A.1 contains other details on implementing the machine learning methods, includ- ing the optimizer, training scheme, and infrastructure. We do not tune or optimize the hyper- parameters, the architecture, or the training scheme to improve the results. 3.2 Prediction results Table 1 reports the OOS prediction accuracy of each method. We cumulatively add sets of predictors in the columns from left to right to highlight the prediction improvement from using larger data sets. The rows correspond to different prediction methods. We express the accuracy in two R2\u2019s. Panel A reports the explained percentage of the total sum of squared errors of log dollar volume relative to e\u03b7, the residual after controlling for the five-day moving average. Panel B converts that to the percentage in the total sum of squared of log of dollar volume ( ev). Lastly, Panel C reports the number of parameters estimated in each model with each set of predictors. Volume is highly predictable. The most sophisticated model using all predictors can predict 14Specifically, the bottom hidden layer in the aforementioned 3-layer network is upgraded to an lstm layer with 32 hidden states and cell states, with the rest of the two layers unchanged. Lstm is a standard and popular type of rnn with four specific internal mechanisms, or gates, that control the flow of information from both the short- and long-term past (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).

In comparison, daily stock returns are hardly predictable with a positive OOS R2, even with state of the art models and predictors, and monthly returns are only slightly predictable (Gu, Kelly, and Xiu, 2020). Even simple ols models can deliver double-digit R2, especially when using the largest set of predictors, but the nn and rnn add an additional 3-4% of OOS R2predictability.15 Adding more predictors improves accuracy in general. All 175 predictors can increase the R2 by more than three percentage points compared to just the eight technical signals. The exception is that adding the large set of fundamental signals (fund-2) makes the methods (even ML methods) 15We experimented with regularization on the linear model (lasso and ridge regressions), and did not find significant improvements. 15perform a little worse. This may be due to overfitting when the number of features increases and where we do not use regularization techniques to try to correct for that. The predictors associated with expected returns do not necessarily work for predicting volume. Market-wide calendar events are quite effective in capturing volume changes, however. Scheduled earning announcements also add a sizable gain in prediction accuracy. The results show that machine learning is critical, and that complexity has its virtue in the context of predicting volume. The prediction accuracy of the rnn is better than the nn, which in turn is better than ols, uniformly across each configuration of included predictors. Panel C shows the improved prediction accuracy is achieved through a significant increase in the number of parameters, a measure of model complexity. Appendix A.1 shows the computational costs of the complex models are higher but manageable. Panel B reports an alternative R2measured as the explained percentage of the total variation of ev. Under this metric, the R2is always high since the trailing moving average explains evto a large extent already, and the gain is at most around 1 .2 percentage points on top of ma 5, which does not look impressive. This begs the question: which one is the right metric to gauge the economic value of this statistical task? Similarly, why take the log of volume and not predict dollar volume eVor some other transformation of it? In the next section, we will formulate an economic objective as a function of volume by modeling a portfolio problem and show the economic value from the seemingly small gain in R2is indeed large and valuable. Appendix C.1 reports that larger firms have higher prediction accuracy than smaller firms, while the overall patterns of predictability across methods are robust in each firm size sub-sample. TheR2\u2019s evaluated in the mega firms are roughly twice those of the nano firms. Smaller firms have a greater magnitude of unexpected trading volume shocks that are hardest to predict. This result makes sense since small firms are volatile and have low trading volume, hence unexpected events that give rise to volume spikes are more likely for these firms. This finding indicates that in addition to small firms being less liquid on average, their liquidity is also less predictable and more volatile. In other words, their trading costs are less predictable. We examine whether firms of different size groups should be modeled differently by implementing a mixture of experts (moe) 16method, which is shown to be beneficial for the linear model but not for the neural networks. 4 Volume alpha: the economic value of volume forecasting To quantify the economic value of predicting volume, we set up a portfolio problem that features a tradeoff between tracking a target portfolio versus minimizing trading costs. The key choice is whether to trade aggressively toward the target or passively to avoid trading costs. The optimal balancing point depends on the volume forecast and the trading costs associated with it. We evaluate to what extent more accurate volume forecasts translate to better trading execution. The incentive to trade is modeled with an objective that penalizes the tracking error toward a target portfolio. The tracking target, potentially informed by the various return forecasting signals, is taken as given since the target itself plays a tangential role in the core tradeoff analysis.",

        "content": "Thus, we fix and set aside the return prediction problem to focus on the improvement afforded by the volume prediction problem. Once this problem is solved, we experiment with a range of pre-specified tracking targets to evaluate the economic benefit achieved in different tracking tasks, such as implementing short-term reversal factor portfolios or quantitative strategies. 4.1 Tracking error optimization and its portfolio microfoundation The tracking error objective is modeled with a simple mean-variance portfolio optimization frame- work. In this framework, the tracking target is rooted in return forecasts. Regardless of the mean-variance microfoundation, the tracking error objective is also relevant for circumstances such as tracking a benchmark index. Consider a portfolio manager who chooses dollar portfolio positions xi,tin stock iat the start of day tto maximize a mean-variance certainty equivalence, adjusted for trading costs: A(1 +rf,t) +X ixi,tmi,t\u2212\u03b3 2AX i,jxi,txj,t\u03c32 ij,t\u2212X iTradingCost i,t, (1) where Ais the manager\u2019s assets under management (AUM) or fund size and \u03b3is her risk aversion 17coefficient.16To improve the investment outcome, much empirical work has been devoted to pre- dicting mean excess returns ( mi,t) and the variance-covariances ( \u03c32 ij,t). Instead, we assume a simple form for the return moments and take them as given in order to illustrate the economic value solely of the trading cost term. Assuming Varri=\u03c32, with zero covariances, the objective function is \u2212\u03b3\u03c32 2AX i\u0012 xi,t\u2212A \u03b3\u03c32mi,t\u00132 \u2212X iTradingCost i,t+\u0012 A(1 +rf,t) +A 2\u03b3\u03c32X im2 i,t\u0013 . (2) The task is to balance the tradeoff between the first term, which is the tracking error penalty as the result of the mean-variance optimization, and the second term, the transaction cost, to be detailed below. The third term can be ignored in the optimization since it is irrelevant to the xchoices. The tracking error penalty (first term) is quadratic, TrackingError i,t:=1 2\u00b5(xi,t\u2212x\u2217 i,t)2, (3) where the target x\u2217is the before-cost mean-variance efficient portfolio position, which increases in the asset\u2019s return expectations as well as the total portfolio size A. In implementation, the trading target is formed in a separate process without immediate trading cost consideration. We analyze a general strategy that optimizes the trading rate toward the target based on volume predictions. Parameter \u00b5:=\u03b3\u03c32 Acontrols the strength of the tracking error penalty. In later empirical analyses, we do not calibrate \u00b5from risk coefficients but instead treat it as a hyperparameter and tune the optimal \u00b5under various AUM levels according to investment performance. Still, the qualitative relationship is preserved \u2013 a larger investor penalizes tracking error (measured in dollars) less, meaning they trade less aggressively toward the target in general. Trading costs are modeled as, TradingCost i,t:=1 2e\u03bbi,t(xi,t\u2212x0 i,t)2, (4) 16We consider a simple situation where the AUM is constant due to an immediate payout program, see Eq. 13 for detail. In the second term, the risk aversion coefficient is explicitly adjusted by Asuch that the before-cost Markowitz optimal dollar position, x\u2217, scales up with A. 18where x0is the starting position. We specify e\u03bbas a function of volume: e\u03bb= 0.2/eV= 0.2 exp(\u2212ev), following Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz (2018). Underlying the quadratic functional form, it is assumed that the price impact is linear in the trade\u2019s size relative to the volume of the day (a.k.a. participation rate): PriceImpact = 0.1x\u2212x0 eV(Kyle, 1985). For example, buying (or selling) 10% of the daily volume would move the price by 1% (or \u22121%). And the trading cost is the price impact multiplied by the dollar trade size: TradingCost =PriceImpact \u00b7(x\u2212x0).17 The aggregate tracking error optimization problem is, min {xi,t}X i,t(TrackingError i,t+TradingCost i,t). (5) Central to our paper, evi,t, or equivalently e\u03bbi,t, is not known when choosing xi,t(emphasized by the tilde). One must predict them based on available conditioning information represented by predictors Xi,t. Taking x0 i,tandx\u2217 i,tas given, the problem becomes {i, t}-separable.18Then, the problem is min x\u2208\u03c3(X)E\u00141 2e\u03bb(x\u2212x0)2+1 2\u00b5(x\u2212x\u2217)2\u0015 .19 4.2 Normalized tracking error and trading rate ( z) To implement this problem empirically, we first normalize the problem by the target trade size x\u2217\u2212x0so that we analyze the loss for a one-dollar target trade. The problem scales quadratically: a $1,000-dollar target trade will incur 106times the loss of a $1-trade.",

In this case, all the analyses carries through but evwill be twice as large.

Being able to separate x\u2217, x0affords many conveniences. It means the core problem is independent of the target strategy or fund size. It allows us to look at each i, tobservation independently in a volume prediction setting. After the prediction task is done, we evaluate the investment performance under various pre-specified target strategies ( x\u2217) with different AUM levels. 4.3 The optimal policy ignoring forecast error (function s) Suppose ev=vand we ignore the inaccuracy in the prediction, the optimal policy is then, s(v;\u00b5) := arg min zlossecon(v, z;\u00b5) =\u00b5 \u00b5+\u03bb=1 1 + exp ( \u2212v+ log 0 .2\u2212log\u00b5).

Additionally, the optimal zalso does not explicitly depend on the scale of the fund.

In that case, they will trade more aggressively uniformly across v, as illustrated by the upward displacement of the dashed curve in Figure 2. 5 Machine learning for the economic value of volume prediction We provide empirical methods to construct the policy of choosing zgivenX. 215.1 The statistical and economic tasks of volume prediction We consider two ways of approaching the portfolio optimization problem. The first conducts a statistical prediction of volume and then plugs the volume forecasts into the optimal trading policy s(v;\u00b5) to form a trading plan. This indirect approach we call \u201cstatistical\u201d learning. The second is an economic learning approach, which instead learns trading rate zas a function of conditioning information directly to minimize the economic loss. We argue directly choosing zis also \u201cpredicting volume,\u201d but with a different optimization objective rather than the least squares loss commonly used in statistical predictions. We term this approach \u201ceconomic\u201d learning. We show their theoretical differences: the economic loss penalizes inaccuracies in volume forecasting asymmetrically, where overestimating volume is more costly. Therefore the model optimized for the economic goal should be more conservative, at the expense of compromising on accuracy measured in terms of squared errors. \u2022Approach 1, statistical learning: Step 1: run machine learning regressions of evontoXin the training sample as in Section 3 v\u2217(\u00b7) = arg min v(\u00b7)X i,t\u2208train(evi,t\u2212v(Xi,t))2. (10) Step 2: plug the OOS predictions bvi,t:=v\u2217(Xi,t) into policy equation (9) to trade bzi,t= s(bvi,t;\u00b5). \u2022Approach 2, economic learning: parameterize zas a neural network, optimize the economic objective in the training sample z\u2217(\u00b7) = arg min z(\u00b7)X i,t\u2208trainlossecon(evi,t, z(Xi,t);\u00b5) (11) and trade bzi,t=z\u2217(Xi,t) in the testing sample.21 The difference between the two approaches boils down to the different loss functions deployed in penalizing volume prediction errors. For example, a trading action bz=z(X) implies an underlying 21For both approaches, the machine learning framework can be rnn or nn, in which Xi,tincludes concurrent and lagged predictors ( X) or only the concurrent. 22volume forecast bv=s\u22121(bz;\u00b5), and equivalently the economic loss can be written as a function of thez-implied vinstead of zitself: lossecon vv(ev, v;\u00b5) :=lossecon(ev, s(v;\u00b5);\u00b5). Hence, the economic learning approach is equivalent to first solving min v(\u00b7)X i,t\u2208trainlossecon vv(evi,t, v(Xi,t);\u00b5) (12) followed by the s(\u00b7;\u00b5) transformation, which is also required in the first approach. Given that the two approaches are only different in the loss functions, we compare lossecon vv with the least squares loss function, lossls(ev, v) :=1 2(v\u2212ev)2, used in statistical predictions. To understand how the two approaches behave differently, first note that the two functions are the same for the smallest possible loss being attained, which is when the forecast, vexactly equals the target, ev. In empirical experiments, we label the strategy made with perfect foresight \u201coracle\u201d as the unattainable ideal ( bvi,t=evi,t), which yields the smallest mean squared error (MSE) and smallest mean economic loss (MEL). Second, both loss functions monotonically increase as the forecast vdeviates away from the true ev. Therefore, it is intuitive to think that making forecasts that are close to evin the least squares sense, will translate to better portfolio implementation as evaluated by the economic loss.22How- ever, forecast errors will not guarantee this outcome because of the differences between the two loss functions. From a theoretical perspective, it is well known that the conditional expectation, E[ev|X], is the minimizer of the problem min v\u2208\u03c3(X)E\u0002 lossls(ev, v)\u0003 , so that the statistical learn- ing method recovers the conditional expectation with the neural network tools. However given a different economic loss function, Proposition 1. The least squares minimizer, E[ev|X] = arg min v\u2208\u03c3(X)E\u0002 lossls(ev, v)\u0003 , does not optimize the economic loss minimization problem minv\u2208\u03c3(X)E[lossecon vv(ev, v;\u00b5)]. Even with unlimited data, the \u201cperfect\u201d statistical learning would not optimize the economic prob- 22The above mentioned properties expressed mathematically are arg min vloss(v,ev) =ev,\u2200ev; and loss(v,ev) is in- creasing in |v\u2212ev|,\u2200v,ev.

As is well known, the least squares loss belongs to the Bregman class, the economic loss function does not (proofs in Appendix B.3). More intuitively, we plot and compare the two loss functions in Figure 3. We pick five different true values for ev= 4,8,12,16,20, and respectively plot the loss curves for a range of forecasts v\u2208 [0,24]. The distinguishing feature of the economic loss is its asymmetric penalty for overestimating volume when actual volume is low. For example, the blue loss curve (actual ev= 4) is very high if the forecast is mistakenly large ( v >12). The economic intuition for why this particular forecasting error is so costly is that it implies trading aggressively ( zclose to 1) when actual liquidity is low. Analytically, lim z\u21911lossecon(ev, z;\u00b5) =e\u03bb, which increases exponentially if evis small. In contrast, errors in the other direction are much more forgiving (e.g., the purple curve withev= 20).23Trading too little when actual liquidity turns out to be ample delivers a loss 23Notice the vertical axis is in log scale, meaning the purple is much more flat compared to blue in terms of the difference of its right and left ends. The same plot in linear scale is in Appendix Figure B.2. 24equal to the opportunity cost of not better tracking the target portfolio, which is fixed at \u00b5 (lim z\u21930lossecon(ev, z;\u00b5) =\u00b5,\u2200ev). In summary, for low levels of true volume, overestimating vol- ume is very costly, but for high levels of volume, the economic cost of volume forecast error is relatively small. We state the asymmetric property formally in Proposition 4 in Appendix B.4, and provide further analysis. The analytical results rely on the quadratic functional forms assumed in equations (3) and (4). However, the qualitative points carry over to more general settings. These findings have important implications. Off-the-shelf machine learning tools are not the most suitable for specific portfolio problems because they minimize statistical error rather than economic error. Hence, an altered financial machine learning design that accounts for economic loss can be more effective. The ranking of forecasts evaluated by the two loss functions can be reversed \u2013 a set of forecasts with a smaller sample MSE might have a greater economic loss \u2013 something we will see empirically in Table 2. The asymmetry in the economic loss has important implications for implementing a model optimized for the statistical criteria to the trading task. The model should \u201clearn\u201d to be more careful about the potential of a liquidity dry-up and be conservative in avoiding overestimating volume. When necessary, it should compromise least squares accuracy in favor of minimizing economic losses. Both the statistical and economic learning approaches are implemented with neural networks, given the many benefits of deep learning such as the ability to handle high-dimensional data and non-linear relations. Next, we emphasize one aspect of the implementation that is particularly relevant for transferring statistical learning results to finance applications such as portfolio opti- mization. 5.2 Transfer learning via pre-training and fine-tuning We implement a transfer learning paradigm in which the statistical and economic learning models are trained sequentially, as illustrated in Figure 4 right panel.

It enjoys off-the-shelf machine learning programs optimized for this typical task. The background knowledge can be transferred to more specific downstream tasks such as portfolio optimization in our case. The finance-motivated tasks benefit from a good \u201cfoundation\u201d. Fine- tuning the pre-trained foundation model per the economic loss objective further improves the economic performance. The different specific downstream tasks require separate economic training routines. (The tasks are different because the economic loss function is modulated by \u00b5.) The same pre-trained foundation model serves as the common starting point for different downstream fine-tuning routines.24 Pre-training optimizes a nn or rnn from Xtob\u03b7(the blue part in Figure 4 left panel) as described in the previous section. Using the pre-trained network as is, flowing the output b\u03b7through additional transformations, \u201c+ma 5\u201d and \u201csigmoid s(\u00b7;\u00b5)\u201d shown in black, the resulting bzimplements the plug-in step. Taking this foundation model as the initialization, fine-tuning conducts further stochastic gradient descent in the economic loss function evaluated at the same training sample. The resulting fine-tuned network implements the economic learning approach. Only the trainable part (in blue) is updated in fine-tuning. The economic approach only innovates on the loss function, not the network architecture or data. Neural networks tackle the non-linearity not only in the predictive relationship but also in the (marginal) economic loss function. Experiments show fine- tuning requires only a small number of epochs of training to significantly improve OOS economic performance compared to the pre-trained foundation model.25 Many other finance problems share a similar structure, in which statistical results are transferred into actionable strategies that are applied towards an economically motivated problem. Markowitz portfolio optimization is a classic example. Another example is financial risk management, which relies on volatility forecasts. The transfer learning procedure adopted here provides a unified framework for applying machine learning techniques in these scenarios.26The procedure is also 24An even lower-level downstream task is to make decisions given target position x\u2217. We do not directly train for that, but do evaluate the performance in such trading experiments further below. 25Alternatively, side-stepping pre-training but directly training for the economic loss from scratch is generally less robust and takes more time (epochs over the sample) to train, probably because the machine learning program is not optimized for such a loss. Not to mention that each \u00b5would require a separate training routine as they do not share the common pre-trained baseline. 26Some financial machine learning studies, including Jensen et al. (2022), Chen et al. (2023), Cong et al. (2021) and Chen, Pelger, and Zhu (2023) involve directly training for the economic target. 26Figure 4: Network architecture and transfer learning procedure economic learning (fine-tuning for downstream tasks) each requires dif ferent trainingplus input layer (predictors )fully-connected hidden layersma5 residual connectionsigmoid: trainable networktraining start foundation model (generic predictive model) trading modelsstatistical learning (pre-training for upstream task) The left illustration shows the network architecture.

(The percentage reduction in MSE is then the R2predicting e\u03b7as in Table 1 Panel A.) The four columns correspond to different \u00b5values that modulate the economic loss function, representing four different downstream economic tasks relevant to different 27AUM magnitudes. As the AUM decreases, the relevant economic objective is parameterized by a greater \u00b5, such that overall trading becomes more aggressive. The average trading rate ranges from trading conservatively near the starting position (13% for AUM = $10b) to trading almost all the way to the target position (95% for AUM = $10m). The rows include the statistical prediction methods described in Section 3 (ma 5, ols, nn, and rnn). Additionally, the economic learning approaches (those ending with \u201c.econ\u201d) conduct fine- tuning on top of the statistical forecasts to optimize the economic loss function under the four different \u00b5\u2019s. The lines spanning the columns indicate that the statistical forecasts do not vary with \u00b5, whereas economic learning generates different ( z-implied) volume forecasts as \u00b5varies. The predictor sets include the 8 \u201ctech\u201d signals or \u201call\u201d of the 175 signals. Looking first at the statistical performances of the forecasts, model complexity and feature rich- ness help reduce MSE. Configuration rnn allyields the highest R2\u224820%. However, smaller MSEs do not necessarily lead to better economic performance. For example, nn techaccrues greater MELs than ols tech, albeit nn is more accurate in terms of R2(comparing Panels A and B). For the low AUM task in particular, the various volume forecasts are even worse than the baseline ma 5, likely due to the need to trade aggressively in this task and the disproportional penalty when aggressive trades are the result of overestimating volume. This result is intuitive given the theoretical analysis, and argues why economic fine-tuning produces better OOS portfolio performance. The economic training methods lead to better economic outcomes. The fine-tuned networks with all the predictors yield the best performance, reaching an OOS economic performance that is about 43% \u223c70% of the unattainable oracle benchmark at various AUM scales. These improved OOS outcomes are not mechanically guaranteed since the fine-tuning is to minimize in-sample loss. The empirical results demonstrate the validity of the economic learning design. Looking at Panel B\u2032, the statistical accuracy retreats after fine-tuning, often to levels even worse than the ma 5 baseline resulting in negative R2. This means to achieve improvements in economic outcomes, the models compromise MSE. Optimal trading actions are conservative against volume overestimation given the economic loss function.

This can be explained by the changes in the economic loss functions. With a smaller \u00b5, trading is more intensive in general ( scurve in Figure 2 shift to the left). That means the penalty for overestimating low volume is more stringent and takes effect earlier (dashed curves in Figure 3 shift to the left). Thus, for smaller AUM, there is a greater difference between the least squares loss and the economic loss. 6 Investment performance in trading experiments We now apply the analysis to real-world investment portfolios in a set of trading experiments. 6.1 Trading experiment design The trading experiment forms a set of trades xi,tby applying the various trading strategies detailed in the previous section to dynamically track a set of given target positions x\u2217 i,t. The target positions are not optimized on trading cost considerations, but formed in a separate process focused solely on return prediction. We evaluate the outcome of the implemented trades xi,t, including the mean return, Sharpe ratio, and turnover, in the OOS period. We examine whether a volume prediction method brings improved investment performance net of trading costs and tracking error considerations. Various sets of target positions {x\u2217 i,t}are exogenously supplied to mimic realistic trading tasks. The first set of experiments mimic a quantitative strategy. We simulate an extremely profitable before-cost trading strategy assuming the agent can, with some probability, forecast the realized direction of stock price change. We experiment with different AUM levels, in which the dollar positions scale linearly while the trading costs increase quadratically. As a result, the optimal \u00b5, which controls the overall trading aggressiveness, varies. The second set of experiments tracks monthly-rebalanced factor portfolios sorted on firm characteristics from the literature as the trading targets. These experiments reveal the effectiveness of volume prediction across the spectrum of investment styles. Given the target {x\u2217 i,t}, the implemented trading outcome {xi,t}is constructed following the 30trading rate strategy, such as bzi,t= rnn.econ( Xi,t;\u00b5), which is formed in the training sample. In particular, xi,t=x0 i,t+bzi,t(x\u2217 i,t\u2212x0 i,t),where the starting position is formed recursively as x0 i,t:=xi,t\u22121Rraw i,tandRraw i,t= 1 + rf,t\u22121+ri,tis the arithmetic raw return accrued on day t\u22121.27 Note the dynamic effect here: the portfolio choice matters for the starting position on the next day, although the optimization does not explicitly consider it. Additionally, the target amount to trade x\u2217\u2212x0, varies across i, t, which is another aspect abstracted from in the theoretical analysis. Given the resulting trades {xi,t}, the accounting of the investment outcome is standard. The daily dollar payoff is such that the AUM is fixed over time: payofft=A(1 +rf,t) +X ixi,teri,t\u2212X iTradingCost i,t\u2212A.

We simulate a trading signal that, with 1% chance, perfectly forecasts whether a stock goes up or down over the next five days. The signal is independent across i, t. Following the signal, all stocks are 27To initiate the recursive calculation, let x0 i,t= 0 on the first day a stock appears in the sample. 31allocated to either the long or the short group. When no signal is received, the stock position stays the same. We let, x\u2217 i,tbe the equal-weighted long-short strategy in which each leg sums up to 50% of the AUM. This portfolio has an unrealistically high before-cost OOS Sharpe ratio of around 7, which is brought down substantially (to more reasonable levels) after trading costs. We experiment with a sequence of AUM magnitudes up to $10 billion which command varying levels of trading costs. We first evaluate across a grid of \u00b5values that vary the aggressiveness of trades, and then perform the \u00b5-tuning method that allows for the comparison of the highest investment performance attained by each volume prediction method. We run a trading experiment for every method and each \u00b5value for various AUM levels. Each experiment plots one dot in Figure 5, with OOS turnover versus mean return (or Sharpe ratio) as the coordinates. Each curve corresponds to one method, connecting the dots with varying \u00b5values. To understand the general shape of the curves, first, note that under different \u00b5values, the strategies vary from always passively holding ( z= 0) to trading all the way to the target ( z= 1). As the implemented portfolio becomes more aggressive ( \u00b5increase), the turnover increases. On the vertical axis, the mean return (or Sharpe ratio) first increases as a result of active trading for profit and then bends downward due to trading costs, whose effect shows up with high turnover. The two opposing forces result in the inverted U-shaped curves. For higher AUM, the trading costs\u2019 effect is stronger, resulting in lower inverted U\u2019s that peak at smaller turnover levels (i.e., lower \u00b5values). In the next subsection, We implement the highest attainable investment outcome by selecting the \u00b5value from the peak of the in-sample curves. The investment gain of a better trading rate strategy z(X) is shown in the vertical displacement of the curves. The improvement comes from two aspects. First, more closely tracking the target portfolio delivers a higher return. Second, reducing trading costs when liquidity is expected to be low, for a given amount of turnover, lowers the trading cost drag on the portfolio. These two objectives are contradictory in our framework, hence the value of predicting volume more accurately is to strike a better balance in the tradeoff between trading costs and tracking error. At the two extremes of the curves ( \u00b5= 0 or + \u221e), there is no room for tradeoff, and hence predicting volume 32Figure 5: Trading experiment performance, with only tech predictors 0510Mean return after tcost (%, annualized) AAUM =$10b BAUM =$1b CAUM =$100m 0.5 1.0 1.5 Turnover (annualized)036Sharpe ratio (annualized) D 0.5 1.0 1.5 Turnover (annualized) E 0.5 1.0 1.5 Turnover (annualized) F method: oracle ma5 olstech nntech rnntech nn.econtech rnn.econtech Figure 6: Trading experiment performance, with all predictors 0510Mean return after tcost (%, annualized) AAUM =$10b BAUM =$1b CAUM =$100m 0.5 1.0 1.5 Turnover (annualized)036Sharpe ratio (annualized) D 0.5 1.0 1.5 Turnover (annualized) E 0.5 1.0 1.5 Turnover (annualized) F method: oracle ma5 olsall nnall rnnall nn.econall rnn.econall Each dot plots the outcome of one trading experiment: the horizontal coordinate is turnover, vertical is the mean return or Sharpe ratio.

Comparing the methods, we can analyze the sources of improvement. First, using the full set of predictors is better than using only the set of technical predictors, which is still much better than no additional information besides the five-day moving average. Second, holding the information set constant, the neural network model predicts volume better than linear regression. Lastly, given the pre-trained neural network, further fine-tuning the trading strategy by directly optimizing the investment performance provides further improvement. Finally, we tune the hyperparameter \u00b5to report each method\u2019s highest attainable investment performance. We choose the \u00b5value that maximizes the in-sample expected return (or Sharpe ratio) and report the out-of-sample performance at the tuned \u00b5. Effectively, \u00b5is selected from the peaks of the in-sample version of the curves (not plotted) and then applied to the OOS curves (as plotted). We expect the in-sample and OOS curves to peak at relatively close \u00b5ranges so that the method attains an OOS performance close to the peak of the OOS curves. 28The \u201crelevant AUM\u201d row in Table 2 is calculated according to the \u00b5-tuning result under each AUM level under method ma 5. 34The results are reported in Table 3. Applying better prediction methods and using a larger set of predictors improves investment performance uniformly across AUM levels. The economic magnitude of improvement is significant, comparable to if not more than the marginal improvement from innovating on return prediction signals. For $10b of AUM, the average annual return increases from 3.88% when using the baseline prediction method of only a 5-day moving average volume, to 4.68% when making volume predictions with an economic objective optimization imbedded within a rnn. For $1b AUM, the magnitude of improvement is even greater, going from 6.47% to 8.98%, and more than doubling the Sharpe ratio from 2.21 to 4.53. For smaller AUM ( $10m), the improvement is still noticeable but smaller, because price impact shrinks and all methods therefore prescribe trading very aggressively. The investment performance converges to the high before-cost level regardless of the prediction method. For more realistic considerations, future research could consider per-unit trading costs such as bid-ask spread in addition to price impacts, which tend to show up as dollar trade sizes shrink. 6.3 Implementing factor zoo portfolios As another set of trading experiments, we use as trading targets the portfolios sorted on character- istics in the JKP dataset that come from the asset pricing literature. The goal is to examine the improvement in implementation outcomes across different investment styles. For each of the 153 characteristics, the target {x\u2217 i,t}is formed in a standard fashion without considering trading costs: at the start of every month, the cross section of stocks is split at the 50th quantile into equal-weighted long-short portfolios based on each characteristic. We fix the AUM at $10 billion ( $5 billion for each of long and short legs).",

The plots show volume prediction from the rnn.econ allbenefits portfolio imple- mentation across the factors. The average gain in mean after-cost return across factors is 0.44% per year from volume prediction alone using the rnn.econ allmodel versus the simple moving average. Almost all of the 153 factors have positive gains. With the $10b AUM scale, this translates into an additional $44m per year in implementation cost-saving from improved volume prediction. Across factors, the gain is larger for those factors with higher turnover. In the right region of Figure 7, some raw factors have a turnover approaching six (600% per year or roughly turning over half of the AUM every month). The gains for these factors, including various short-term reversal strategies, are around 0.5% to 1.0%. These factors are constructed with technical signals over a shorter window.29In the left part of the figure, even factors with low turnover (those relying on 29Examples: ret10short term reversal; iskew capm 21didiosyncratic skewness from the CAPM; iskew ff321d idiosyncratic skewness from the FF3F; rmax5 rvol 21dhighest 5 days of return; rskew 21dreturn skewness 21d; seas 11an1 Year Annual Seasonality; and coskew 21dcoskewness. 36quarterly fundamental signals and signals with greater persistency) show gains that range from 0.2% to 0.6% per year from volume prediction. Appendix Figure C.3 plots the same gains in the vertical axis but changes the horizontal axis to the mean return attained by ma 5, i.e., the baseline level in the gain calculation. The figure shows that, regardless of the baseline, the gain is independently distributed around a positive center. That is, a better volume prediction is uniformly effective, and the improvement is not concentrated on factors that have positive (or negative) realized returns. Appendix Figure C.4 reports similar plots with gains measured in Sharpe ratio space instead of mean returns. 7 Conclusion We translate volume predictability into net-of-cost portfolio performance by linking it to expected trading costs \u2013 a term we call \u201ctrading volume alpha.\u201d Volume is highly predictable, especially when using machine learning techniques, large data signals, and exploiting the virtue of complexity in prediction. We find that volume prediction can be as valuable as return prediction in achieving optimal mean-variance portfolios net of trading costs.",

        "content": "We find that incorporating an economic objective function directly into machine learning is even more effective for obtaining useful predictions. This feature may be general to many finance applications of machine learning, where incorporating the economic objective directly may dominate a two-step process that first satisfies some statistical objective and then incorporates that statistical object into an economic framework. For volume prediction, the asymmetric cost of overestimating versus underestimating volume is captured (ignored) by an economic (statistical) objective, and delivers sizeable economic impact. While we find substantial economic benefits from volume predcition using our framework and methods, there is much room for improvement. Our goal is not to develop the best trading cost model or even the best volume prediction model, but rather to translate the prediction problem into economic consequences, which yield interesting insights. A more exhaustive search for prediction variables and models that forecast volume more accurately could translate into even larger economic 37benefits than we show here. Some promising candidates for additional features and methods are lead-lag volume relations across stocks, more seasonal indicators, other market microstructure variables, and more complex nn and rnn models. Our simple framework for predicting and characterizing volume alpha also has limitations. For one, we study a very simple functional form for trading costs that maps volume prediction directly into costs. Other functional forms and other determinants of costs beyond volume may lead to novel results. In addition, we separate the volume prediction problem from the expected return and variance/covariance modeling problem. Combining all three could generate further portfolio improvements and the interaction between these three prediction problems could be enlightening. Lastly, our trading experiments are merely a tool to illustrate some possible applications of our insights, but are not designed to optimize any performance outcome. Specifically, two things not considered in our design are: dynamic effects from trading and heterogeneous trade tasks. Adding these more complex features would be an interesting area for future research. Trading volume prediction in general is an interesting research area worthy of further explo- ration. While we have couched the volume prediction problem into a portfolio context to translate the problem into economic consequences, understanding the role of volume more generally \u2013 its causes and consequences \u2013 is interesting. Using some of our techniques may shed light on this question and may help pinpoint what components of volume are most valuable to trading costs and, as a byproduct, portfolio construction. For example, informed versus uninformed volume, volume with temporary versus permanent price impact, and short- versus long-term volume may be interesting research pursuits. Examining various aspects of volume could be very useful for improving portfolio optimization and understanding trading activity more broadly. We leave these issues for future work. 38References Amihud, Y. 2002. Illiquidity and stock returns: Cross-section and time-series effects. Journal of Financial Markets 5:31\u201356.

(When increasing the sequence length from 10 to 50, the results had minimum improvements but required much larger GPU memory and longer training time.) For data points at the beginning of a stock\u2019s observed period where lagged predictors (e.g., Xi,t\u22129) are not available, we fill in with zero vectors. 42In training both nn and rnn models, we use the Adam optimizer, with default learning rates and other parameters. The batch size is 1024. The e\u03b7prediction models are trained with 50 epochs. For the sake of clear benchmarking, we do not adopt early stopping, weights dropout, or hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation, though these techniques could further boost the prediction accuracy. The machine learning program is implemented with the PyTorch package.

The learning curves show the gap between the IS and OOS R2is relatively small, and does not widen with continued training. This indicates limited in-sample overfitting at this neural network configuration. The rnn learning curves show slightly more severe overfitting, though the OOS learning curve is still relatively stable as training continues. The learning curves display fluctuation due to the randomness of the stochastic gradient descent, though the extent to which is not severe. We also note the exact results depend on the inherent randomness of the training program. We find the quantitative results are insensitive to random seeds and report the average of five independent runs to obtain a robust evaluation outcome. Table A.1 summarizes computational costs in terms of the training times and memory usage for nn and rnn with all predictors for a single random seed. These experiments were conducted on a system equipped with an Nvidia A100 GPU with 40 GB of GPU memory, an AMD EPYC 7713 64-Core Processor @ 1.80GHz with 128 cores, and 1.0TB of RAM, running Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS. 43Table A.1: Training time and memory usage Training time (hours) CPU memory usage (GB) GPU memory usage (GB) nnall 0.48 10.87 1.22 rnnall 0.63 144.98 1.48 B Additional theoretical analysis B.1 Microfoundation of the tracking error part in the portfolio objective The track error penalty term in the portfolio optimization objective function can be economically founded. We show the quadratic tracking error penalty can be derived from a mean-variance utility function. This analysis connects the target positions x\u2217 ito the before-cost mean-variance efficient portfolio weight, which increases in the asset\u2019s return expectations as well as the total portfolio size (AUM). It also provides a microfoundation of the hyperparameter \u00b5and the quadratic penalty: as the position deviates away from the target, the mean-variance loss increases in a quadratic fashion. Assume the agent has a mean-variance utility function, U=EA\u2032\u2212\u03b3 2AVarA\u2032\u2212TCost, where A\u2032is the before-cost investment outcome, Ais the initial wealth (AUM), and \u03b3is the risk aversion coefficient, TCost is the term for the objective of minimizing transaction costs (not the focus here as we are justifying the tracking error part). A\u2032is the outcome of the portfolio strategy: A\u2032=A(1 + rf) +P ixiri,where xiis the dollar position in risky asset iwith excess return ri. Assume Eri=mi,Varri=\u03c32, and zero covariances. The agent\u2019s portfolio optimization problem is choosing {xi}to maximize U. Then, the objective function is U=A(1 +rf) +X iximi\u2212\u03b3 2AX ix2 i\u03c32\u2212TCost (16) =X i\u0012 \u2212\u03b3\u03c32 2Ax2 i+mixi\u0013 +A(1 +rf)\u2212TCost (17) =\u2212\u03b3\u03c32 2AX i\u0012 x2 i\u22122A \u03b3\u03c32mixi\u0013 +A(1 +rf)\u2212TCost (18) 44=\u2212\u03b3\u03c32 2AX i\u0012 xi\u2212A \u03b3\u03c32mi\u00132 + A 2\u03b3\u03c32X im2 i+A(1 +rf)! \u2212TCost (19) The first term matches the tracking error term modeled in Eq. 3. The second term is the before TCost utility at the zero tracking error portfolio ( x=x\u2217). This term is constant of the xchoice, hence can be ignored in the optimization problem. Comparing the first term with the tracking error modeled in Eq. 3, we see the target portfolio isx\u2217 i=A \u03b3\u03c32mi. As expected, the target positions are the result of Markowitz mean-variance opti- mization. They are proportional to the return expectations in the cross section.",

Additionally, the overall tracking error penalizing coefficient \u00b5=\u03b3\u03c32 A, which is decreasing in AUM. The rationale is that the quadratic penalty stems from the quadratic risk change as the position deviates away from the target, and that the absolute risk aversion coefficient decreases with the wealth level. Although the main analysis takes \u00b5as a hyperparameter ignoring its microfoundation, we still observe the negative relationship between the tuned \u00b5and the economically relevant AUM (e.g., in Section 5.3). B.2 The economic task as predicting ez We have shown the economic task of choosing the zstrategy, min z(\u00b7)P i,t\u2208trainlossecon(evi,t, z(Xi,t);\u00b5), can be seen as a prediction task of predicting the evwith the economic loss function: min v(\u00b7)P i,t\u2208train lossecon vv(evi,t, v(Xi,t);\u00b5). In this appendix, we provide the equivalent representation as a prediction problem of the oracle trading rate ez:=s(ev;\u00b5). Define lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5) :=lossecon(s\u22121(ez;\u00b5), z;\u00b5), where s\u22121(\u00b7;\u00b5) is inverse of s(\u00b7;\u00b5) function. Under this definition, the economic task can be viewed as the problem of looking for a function z(\u00b7) that maps Xintozto minimize the training sample average loss: min z(\u00b7)X i,t\u2208trainlossecon zz(ezi,t, z(Xi,t);\u00b5) (20) 45According to the definition, the analytical expression of lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5) is lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5) =\u00b5 ez(z\u2212ez)2+\u00b5(1\u2212ez). (21) In this expression, the loss can be seen as the squared zprediction error weighted by\u00b5 ez. The last term is constant of choice zso can be ignored in optimization. It equals lossecon zz(ez,ez;\u00b5), the baseline loss incurred even with the perfect prediction. To derive this expression, notice ezis already defined as the perfect trading given e\u03bborev. ez=\u00b5 \u00b5+e\u03bb=\u21d2e\u03bb=\u00b5 ez\u2212\u00b5 (22) Then, start from Eq. 7, represent e\u03bbwithezand then complete the square: lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5) =e\u03bbz2+\u00b5(1\u2212z)2 =\u0010\u00b5 ez\u2212\u00b5\u0011 z2+\u00b5(1\u2212z)2 =\u00b5 ez(z\u2212ez)2+\u00b5(1\u2212ez) We show lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5) is still meaningfully different from the standard squared error loss function, and that E[ez|X] will not be the optimal choice either further below. B.3 Economic loss functions are not in Bregman class We show functions lossecon vv(ev, v;\u00b5) and lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5) are not in the Bregman class, for all \u00b5. Without loss of generality, any loss function F(p, q) can be normalized as \u00afF(p, q) :=F(p, q)\u2212 F(p, p), such that that the function acquires the convenient property that \u00afF(p, p) = 0, and that the solution to the optimization problem min q\u2208\u03c3{X}E[F(p, q)] does not change. Therefore, in the following propositions, we normalize accordingly and consider lossecon vv(ev, v;\u00b5) :=lossecon vv(ev, v;\u00b5)\u2212 lossecon vv(ev,ev;\u00b5) and lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5) :=lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5)\u2212lossecon zz(ez,ez;\u00b5). The definition of the Bregman loss function is (Banerjee, Guo, and Wang, 2005): 46Definition 1. Let\u03d5:Rd\u2192Rbe a strictly convex differentiable function, then, the Bregman loss function D\u03d5:Rd\u00d7Rd\u2192Ris defined as: D\u03d5(p, q) :=\u03d5(p)\u2212\u03d5(q)\u2212 \u27e8p\u2212q,\u25bd\u03d5(q)\u27e9 (23) We consider the simpler case where p, qare scalars. In this case, a Bregman function has the property that its partial second derivative in the first argument is independent of the second argument. \u22022D\u03d5(p, q) \u2202p2=\u03d5\u2032\u2032(p) (24) The propositions below rely on this property. Proposition 2. Function lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5)is not in the Bregman class, for all \u00b5. Proof. We verify that lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5) violates the property in Eq. 24. lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5) =\u00b5 ez(z\u2212ez)2(25) \u22022lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5) \u2202ez2=2\u00b5z2 ez3(26) It is clear that this is not irrelevant to z. Proposition 3. Function lossecon vv(ev, v;\u00b5)is not in the Bregman class, for all \u00b5. Proof. Given the property in Eq. 24, a Bregman loss function must be unbounded as p\u2192+\u221e. This is because for any fixed q, when p > q ,D\u03d5(p, q) is increasing and convex in p. However, we verify that lossecon vv(ev, v;\u00b5) is bounded by showing it converges to a finite number asev\u2192+\u221e.",

The vertical axis is changed to the linear scale from the log scale. For large ev(12, 16, 20, in green, red, purple), the curves are indistinguishable from a flat line because the blue curve is at a much greater magnitude, which is for the loss of overestimating low actual volume ( ev= 4).

The following proposition formally states the asymmetric property of the loss function for over/under-estimating volume. 48Proposition 4. Consider two symmetrical cases with low and high liquidity ev1andev2such that ez1= 1\u2212ez2<0.5. Suppose one makes an overestimation in the low-volume case bv1=ev1+\u03b5, comparing with an equal amount of underestimation in the high-volume case bv2=ev2\u2212\u03b5, the additional loss incurred in the first case is greater than the second: lossecon vv(ev1,bv1;\u00b5)\u2212lossecon vv(ev1,ev1;\u00b5)> lossecon vv(ev2,bv2;\u00b5)\u2212lossecon vv(ev2,ev2;\u00b5),\u2200\u00b5 >0. (29) Proof. We first show that, given ez2= 1\u2212ez1, as well as bv1\u2212ev1=ev2\u2212bv2=\u03b5, we have bz2= 1\u2212bz1, and that ez1\u2212bz1=bz2\u2212ez2. We know s(v;\u00b5) =1 1+exp( \u2212v+log 0 .2\u2212log\u00b5). From ez1= 1\u2212ez2, we have: 1 1 + exp( \u2212ev2+ log 0 .2\u2212log\u00b5)= 1\u22121 1 + exp( \u2212ev1+ log 0 .2\u2212log\u00b5) exp(\u2212ev1\u2212ev2+ 2 log 0 .2\u22122 log\u00b5) = 1 ev2= 2(log 0 .2\u2212log\u00b5)\u2212ev1 (30) Then we have: bz1+bz2=1 1 + exp( \u2212ev1\u2212\u03b5+ log 0 .2\u2212log\u00b5)+1 1 + exp( \u2212ev2+\u03b5+ log 0 .2\u2212log\u00b5) =1 1 + exp( \u2212ev1\u2212\u03b5+ log 0 .2\u2212log\u00b5)+1 1 + exp( ev1+\u03b5\u2212log 0.2 + log \u00b5)= 1 The last equation comes from the fact that1 1+exp( x)+1 1+exp( \u2212x)= 1. Then we make use of the loss function expressed in terms of ezandz, as defined in Eq. 21: lossecon zz(ez, z;\u00b5) =\u00b5 ez(z\u2212ez)2+\u00b5(1\u2212ez) (31) Sinceez1\u2212bz1=bz2\u2212ez2andez1<ez2, that is\u00b5 ez1>\u00b5 ez2, we have the required result: lossecon vv(ev1,bv1;\u00b5)\u2212lossecon vv(ev1,ev1;\u00b5)> lossecon vv(ev2,bv2;\u00b5)\u2212lossecon vv(ev2,ev2;\u00b5),\u2200\u00b5 >0.

As explained in the main text, smaller firms have a greater magnitude of unexpected trading volume shocks that are hardest to predict. This result makes sense since small firms are volatile and have low trading 30The five groups are defined according to the market capitalization breakpoints of NYSE stock percentiles: mega stocks, greater than the 80th percentile; large, 50\u201380; small, 20\u201350; micro, 1-20; and nano, below the 1st percentile. 50volume, hence unexpected events that give rise to volume spikes are more likely for these firms. This finding also indicates that in addition to small firms being less liquid on average, their liquidity is also less predictable and more volatile. Hence, tiny firms are not only costly to trade in general, but their costs are less predictable. These results are intuitive and suggest that our prediction models are capturing true variation in volume and not simply noise. We also examine whether firms of different size groups should be modeled differently. We train a model on each size group separately to attempt to better capture the heterogeneity across the firm size dimension rather than pooling all firms in the same model. We implement a simple mixture of experts (moe) method, where each size group is trained separately to form \u201cexpert\u201d models and then compared against the pooled training model in Panel A. The moe improves performance of the ols method. Comparing the first lines in Panels A and B, linear models catered to different size groups are more accurate than the pooled ols. For nn and rnn, however, the sample size reduction outweighs the potential benefits of separate training, making the mixture of expert models less accurate (either conditioning on size groups or jointly). Since the potential non-linear effects of firm size are already allowed in the neural networks, forcing size groups into different models is less effective. For this reason, we stick with pooled training samples. C.2 Additional results of implementing factor zoo portfolios We provide results on the trading experiments that implement the factor zoo portfolios in addition to Subsection 6.3. Figure C.3 has the same vertical axis as Figure 7, which is the improvement in after-cost mean excess return from ma 5to rnn.econ all. The horizontal axis changes to the mean excess return achieved with the ma 5method, i.e., the baseline level of the improvement. The plot shows the gain is distributed around a positive center uncorrelated with the baseline. That is, a better volume prediction is uniformly effective, and the improvement is not concentrated on factors that have positive (or negative) realized returns. Figure C.4 is the Sharpe ratio version of Figure 7 by showing the gain in Sharpe ratio instead 51of the mean return. The plot shows a similar pattern to the one reported in the main text. The gains in Sharpe ratios are larger for those factors with higher turnover, reaching around 0.3 to 0.4 per year.

We \ufb01rst analyze a benchmark port- folio that sells a constant weight of volatility assets each month. Then, we show that a volatility-managed portfolio, which reduces selling volatility as- sets during periods of heightened volatility, considerably enhances long-run performance. Our \ufb01ndings are robust across variance swaps, VIX futures, and S&P 500 straddles, and even in the presence of transaction costs. An ex-post study indicates that timing portfolios yield positive alpha and reduce expo- sure relative to constant-weight portfolios, mostly during volatility-spike pe- riods rather than stable periods. Our \ufb01ndings help differentiate asset pricing theories on risk-return relations in the volatility asset market. \u2020Aoxiang Yang is with Peking University. Email: aoxiang.yang@phbs.pku.edu.cn.1Introduction It\u2019s well known that sellers of volatility assets earn positive premiums (see e.g., Carr and Madan (1998),Coval and Shumway (2001),Bakshi and Kapadia (2003),Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006),Carr and Wu (2009),Bollerslev and Todorov (2011),Kelly, P\u00e1stor, and Veronesi (2016)). We in this paper ask the following questions: How do long-run investors best harvest volatility risk premiums (VRP)? Is there a simple, ef\ufb01cient way for long-run investors to time VRP? To answer these questions, we consider portfolios similar to Moreira and Muir (2017) and make a modi\ufb01cation by replacing the stock market index with one of three volatility assets: a one-month variance swap contract, a one-month constant-maturity VIX futures portfolio, and a one-month constant-maturity S&P 500 ATM straddle portfolio. For each asset, we adhere to the longest period of available price data: 1990-2023 for variance swaps, 2004-2023 for VIX futures, and 1996-2022 for straddles. We source our data from standard resources such as CBOE and OptionMetrics. Each month t, a portfolio weight of wi t=\u2212cft, (1.1) is assigned to the volatility asset, and the remaining capital is allocated to risk-free as- sets. Here, crepresents a positive scaling constant that is chosen to match the portfolio\u2019s unconditional return standard deviation with that of the S&P 500 index. The term ftrep- resents a timing factor that is expected to demonstrate a positive relationship with the conditional one-month VRP. In other words, we sell more (less) volatility assets when conditional VRP is higher (lower). As noted in Moreira and Muir (2017), portfolio de\ufb01ned in equation ( 1.1) has a desir- able property that researchers cannot manipulate the portfolio\u2019s Sharpe ratio (sometimes called \"information ratio\") or factor-model alpha t-statistics because the scaling constant 1cproportionally affects the mean and standard deviation of portfolio returns. Our benchmark portfolio puts a constant weight on the variance asset each month, i.e.,ft=const . We discover that by setting the constant weight close to -7% for vari- ance swaps, -22% for VIX futures, and -60% for straddles, our portfolio achieves a sim- ilar level of return standard deviation as S&P 500. Although the benchmark portfolio returns exhibit larger negative skewness, kurtosis, and maximum drawdowns than S&P 500, these statistics remain at reasonable and acceptable levels. The benchmark portfo- lios exhibit signi\ufb01cantly better long-run performance relative to S&P 500, as indicated by higher Sharpe ratios, excess returns, and factor-model alphas. Next, we show that the benchmark portfolio\u2019s performance can be signi\ufb01cantly en- hanced by carefully selecting ft. In the same spirit of Moreira and Muir (2017), we set the weight proportional to the inverse of stock market volatility. Speci\ufb01cally, we consider three commonly used volatility measures in the literature: realized volatility (RV), option- implied volatility (VIX), and a GARCH(1,1) conditional one-month volatility forecast: ft= 1/RV t, ft= 1/V IX t, ft= 1/GARCH (1,1)t.(1.2) The choice of setting the weight equal to the inverse of volatility is motivated by recent literature ( Bekaert and Hoerova (2014),Cheng (2019),Cheng (2020),A\u00eft-Sahalia, Kara- man, and Mancini (2020),Lochstoer and Muir (2022),Yang (2022)), which emphasizes that in the data an increase in market volatility is typically associated with a statistically signi\ufb01cant decrease in the conditional one-month VRP.",

        "content": "Cheng (2019) speci\ufb01cally refers to this negative relation as a \"low-premium response puzzle\" as established asset pric- ing theories with time-varying volatility, volatility-of-volatility, disaster risk, and jumps (Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou (2009),Drechsler and Yaron (2011),Wachter (2013),Dew- 2Becker, Giglio, Le, and Rodriguez (2017)) all predict a positive relation. We \ufb01rst use OLS predictive regressions to con\ufb01rm that this negative relation robustly exists both in-sample and out-of-sample during the longest periods 1990-2023. We then follow Moreira and Muir (2017) to use the monthly time-series of three volatility measures to sort the following month\u2019s variance swap returns into \ufb01ve portfolios. We con\ufb01rm that, as we move from the \"lowest volatility\" portfolio to \"highest volatility\" portfolio, overall, average variance swap returns tend to weaken, standard deviation tends to rise, and Sharpe ratio tends to fall in magnitude. We \ufb01nd that all three volatility-managed portfolios de\ufb01ned above improve perfor- mance. Speci\ufb01cally, for variance swaps, we \ufb01nd that our timing portfolio, when com- pared to constant-weight portfolios, enhances the Sharpe ratio from 1.54 to a maximum of 1.76. Additionally, we observe an increase in excess return and Carhart (1997) 4-factor alpha, as well as a reduction in negative skewness, kurtosis, and maximum drawdowns. While our \ufb01ndings are based on using VIX-squared as an approximation for variance swap prices (see, e.g., Carr and Madan (1998)), we demonstrate the robustness of our \ufb01ndings by utilizing actual quoted OTC variance swap price data obtained from Dew- Becker, Giglio, Le, and Rodriguez (2017). Furthermore, we show that our \ufb01ndings are not driven by speci\ufb01c historical periods, as the improved performance holds true even when considering the recent 15-year period. For VIX futures, we consistently \ufb01nd that our timing portfolio, compared to constant- weight portfolios, leads to an improvement in the Sharpe ratio from 0.61 to a maximum of 0.78. Furthermore, we observe an increase in excess return and Carhart (1997) 4-factor alpha (as well as alpha\u2019s t-statistic from 1.1 to a maximum of 2.0), as well as a reduction in negative skewness, kurtosis, and maximum drawdowns. In our previous consideration of variance swaps and VIX futures, we made the sim- plifying assumption that there is no transation cost such as bid-ask spreads and margin 3requirements. We show that introducing bid-ask spreads may reduce the performance of volatility-managed portfolios and constant-weight portfolios, but is unlikely to affect the relative performance between the two. This is because volatility assets all have lim- ited maturities. We need to rebalance whether the portfolio has constant or time-varying weights. Thus, constant-weight portfolios have no advantage over timing portfolios in terms of transaction costs, a signi\ufb01cant difference than equity premium timing in Moreira and Muir (2017). In the case of straddles, we account for margin requirements. Speci\ufb01- cally, we assume that the margin requirement for short selling an S&P 500 ATM straddle is equal to 100% of the selling proceeds plus 20% of the current S&P 500 level, as in Johnson (2017). The inclusion of margin requirements typically results in a reduction in the magni- tude of returns and Sharpe ratios. Despite this fact, we consistently \ufb01nd that our timing portfolios, compared to constant-weight portfolios, improve the Sharpe ratio from 0.51 to a maximum of 0.62. Additionally, we observe an increase in excess return and Carhart (1997) 4-factor alpha (as well as alpha\u2019s t-statistic from 1.2 to a maximum of 1.8), as well as a drop in negative skewness, kurtosis, and maximum drawdowns. What is the economic interpretation of our results? We show that our volatility-managed portfolios work under a similar logic as that in Moreira and Muir (2017). In their study, the volatility-managed portfolios yield improvements relative to market buy-and-hold, primarily driven by the observed tendency for the one-month equity premium to decline following periods of increased volatility during economic downturns. Since high risk is not compensated for by higher risk premia, reducing the weight on the market index in such times helps mitigate further losses or expedite the recovery of values from economic downturns. As a result, the drawdowns experienced during recessions become smaller. Our analysis replaces equity premium with VRP, and S&P 500 with volatility assets. Note that in leading asset pricing models, everything is compensation for risk.",

        "content": "The 4only way to increase returns is to take on more risk. It follows that timing portfolios will never generate an alpha. The fact that our timing portfolios generate an alpha implies that the short-horizon risk-risk premium relation is essentially negative in the data. So far, our timing portfolios have been volatility-managed. This approach offers sev- eral advantages. First, it is easy to implement. Second, it is independent of speci\ufb01c econo- metric models and avoids potential model misspeci\ufb01cation. Johnson (2017) and Cheng (2019), among others, also \ufb01nd that their respective timing strategies, based on ex-ante VRP measures, can improve performance relative to S&P 500 or constant-weight volatil- ity portfolios. To differentiate our approach from existing literature, we consider a fourth strategy that uses a VAR model of ( RVt, V IX t) to estimate ex-ante one-month VRP and then sets weight proportional to it: ft=V RP t\u22611\u2212Et[RVt+1] V IX t. (1.3) We do \ufb01nd that such econometrics-based VRP measures typically help improve port- folio performance. However, it exhibits two disadvantages. First, it typically underper- forms compared to timing portfolios based on volatility measures, especially the GARCH volatility forecasts, which consistently prove to be a robust timing factor relative to others. Second, it shows less robustness across different historical periods and volatility assets. Last but not least, we examine which market conditions have contributed the most to the performance improvements in our timing portfolios. To this end, we partition our data into two regimes: a high-volatility regime and a low-volatility regime. We classify a month tas belonging to the high-volatility (low-volatility) regime if realized volatility (RVt) exceeds (falls below) the 80th percentile of its unconditional distribution, approxi- mately 20. Within each regime, we run various timing portfolio excess returns onto con- temporanous constant-weight portfolio excess returns. Our exercise is similar to Moreira and Muir (2017) which decompose portfolio perfor- 5mance into expansions and recessions, and \ufb01nd that volatility-managed portfolios reduce exposure to MKT more greatly in recessions. Our choice of low versus high-volatility regimes is motivated by Yang (2022) which shows that the negative volatility-VRP relation puzzle is predominantly observed in high-volatility periods, not necessarily recessions.1 We \ufb01nd that various timing portfolios produce positive alpha and help reduce beta/exposure relative to benchmark portfolios mostly during high-volatility regimes, not in low-volatility regimes. We further provide detailed regime-conditional predictability evidence in the Appendix. We \ufb01nd that, aligning with the view in Yang (2022), only large \"structural\" volatility spikes predict negative realized VRPs in the next month, while small volatility shocks in stable periods essentially predict positive VRPs. Our \ufb01ndings thus help differentiate theories on the puzzling negative risk-return rela- tions in the volatility asset market. Cheng (2019) suggests the puzzle is possibly driven by falling hedging demand induced by microstructure frictions or government\u2019s implicit guarantees when volatility turns high. Lochstoer and Muir (2022) explain the puzzle with extrapolative volatility expectations. Yang (2022) attributes the puzzle to investors\u2019 slow and consecutive learning about occasional large underlying structural breaks in volatility. An underlying break (such as those caused by Gulf War, Dot-com Bubble Burst, Global Financial Crisis, and European Debt Crisis) occurs in month t and then lasts for several months. Due to limited rationality, investors do respond sharply, but not sharply enough. Investors\u2019 volatility expectation and pricing of volatility assets consecutively rise. It thus appears that month t+1 realized VRP is negative (i.e., month t+1 volatility asset returns are positive). Since our portfolio already reduces positions when observing the volatil- ity spike in month t, it outperforms constant-weight portfolios. In normal times without structural breaks, there is no such puzzling negative risk-return relation and therefore volatility-managed portfolios do not work. Our \ufb01ndings indeed support Yang (2022)\u2019s 1It is also known that stock market volatility has its own dynamics that is not entirely driven by business cycles. 6channel. However, we note that the above analysis is conducted in an ex-post context. In an ex-post study of portfolio performance, we \ufb01nd that the enhancement is driven by peri- ods of persistent large volatility spikes, which however does not mean there must exist an easy way to leverage this ex-post pattern to further enhance ex-ante timing strategy performance.",

        "content": "The fundamental challenge is that, ex-ante, it is dif\ufb01cult to predict the arrival of large volatility spikes.2Indeed, the unpredictability of volatility spikes is precisely the reason why selling volatility on average earns positive premiums. If volatility spikes were pre- dictable, then there would be much less covariation between investors\u2019 SDF and volatility. Then volatility assets wouldn\u2019t have been thus excessively expensive in stable periods. In short, our timing portfolios exploit the fact that \"although bad states (crises) are unpre- dictable, investors\u2019 slow response to them is.\" Literature. Our research is related to three literatures. First, it is related to the factor timing literature ( Moreira and Muir (2017),Cederburg, ODoherty, Wang, and Yan (2020), Barroso and Detzel (2021),Haddad, Kozak, and Santosh (2020)). A difference is that we time VRPs rather than premiums such as equity and value premiums, etc. Another important difference is that Moreira and Muir (2017)\u2019s volatility managed portfolio works when the timing factor is realized volatility, which negatively predicts next-month returns. Recent work by Martin (2017) shows that implied volatility instead tends to positively predict next-month returns. In contrast, the volatility-VRP relation is negative regardless of how to measure volatility, and thus our timing portfolios work more or less equally 2Volatility spikes, once occurring, immediately result in large negative realized VRPs. During low- volatility periods, where volatility and VRP exhibit small movement, these large negative realized VRPs stand out as outliers that can swiftly attenuate away the positive relations between volatility and next- month realized VRPs (that should have been seen in stable periods). In fact, this is the main reason why we did not observe an increasing pattern of VRPs with volatility levels across the \ufb01rst several \"low volatility\" portfolios when following Moreira and Muir (2017) to sort portfolios based on the current month\u2019s volatility levels. 7well whether the timing factor is realized, implied, or conditional volatility. Other papers that consider VRP timing strategies include, for instance, D\u00f6rries, Korn, and Power (2024),Egloff, Leippold, and Wu (2010),Johnson (2017) and Cheng (2019). Our research differs in several aspects. First, we are the \ufb01rst to consider all three types of vari- ance assets. Second, we are the \ufb01rst to study (model-free) volatility-managed, rather than VRP-managed, portfolios. Third, we study portfolio performance over different subsam- ples. Our paper is also related to Aragon, Chen, and Shi (2022), which show that hedge funds have superior ability to time realized volatility (VRPs) across several asset classes. Second, our research relates to a literature that studies intertemporal risk-return rela- tions in volatility asset markets ( Bekaert and Hoerova (2014),Cheng (2019),Cheng (2020), A\u00eft-Sahalia, Karaman, and Mancini (2020),Lochstoer and Muir (2022),Yang (2022)). This literature has recently emphasized a puzzling negative volatility-VRP relation, inconsis- tent with leading asset pricing theories. Our timing strategies precisely exploit this puz- zle, and our ex-post regime-conditional performance analysis helps differentiate compet- ing theories on the puzzle. Third, our research is related to the large volatility risk premium literature. Among others, Dew-Becker, Giglio, Le, and Rodriguez (2017) study variance swaps; Eraker and Wu(2017) and Cheng (2019) study VIX futures; Carr and Madan (1998),Coval and Shumway (2001),Broadie, Chernov, and Johannes (2007),Carr and Wu (2009),Christoffersen, Jacobs, and Mimouni (2010),Andersen, Fusari, and Todorov (2015),Eraker (2021), and Eraker and Yang (2022) study S&P 500 straddles and options; Johnson (2017) and Lochstoer and Muir (2022) study all three assets. Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006) and Bansal, Kiku, Shaliastovich, and Yaron (2014) estimate VRP in the cross-section of stock returns. Our constant-weight portfolio by construction has the same Sharpe ratio as the original volatility asset returns. We \ufb01nd numbers consistent with those reported in the papers that originally study each particular asset, lending credibility to our results. 82Timing Strategy 2.1 Equity Premium Timing To time equity premium, Moreira and Muir (2017) use a strategy consisting of two assets: the market index and a risk-free asset. Each month t, the weight in the market is wmkt t=c RVt, (2.1) where cis a scaling positive constant whose value is set such that the portfolio has the same unconditional return variance as the market index.

(2.2) Thus, portfolio Sharpe ratio E(rt+1\u2212rf t)/std(rt+1\u2212rf t)is independent of the scaling con- stant c. A researcher cannot manipulate the Sharpe ratio. The authors provide evidence that this strategy generates a signi\ufb01cant alpha and a higher Sharpe ratio compared to the market index. The rationale behind the strategy is that during periods of increased real- ized volatility, particularly during economic downturns, monthly equity premiums tend to decrease. Consequently, reducing the weight assigned to the market index enhances the strategy\u2019s performance. 92.2 Variance Risk Premium Timing 2.2.1 Motivating Evidence Recent literature, such as Cheng (2019) and Lochstoer and Muir (2022), has emphasized that an increase in market volatility typically also leads to a decrease in the conditional one-month Volatility Risk Premium (VRP). Cheng (2019) speci\ufb01cally refers to this nega- tive relation as a \"low-premium response puzzle,\" as established asset pricing theories with time-varying volatility, volatility-of-volatility, disaster risk, and jumps ( Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou (2009),Drechsler and Yaron (2011),Wachter (2013),Dew-Becker, Giglio, Le, and Rodriguez (2017)) all predict a positive relation. In Table 1, we provide additional con\ufb01rmation of the negative relationship between volatility and VRP using OLS predictive regressions. To ensure robustness, we use the longest available data sample and consider three different measures of market volatil- ity: realized volatility (RV), implied volatility (VIX), and a GARCH(1,1) conditional one- month volatility forecast. As shown, consistent with the literature, when volatility rises, the next-month realized returns on a variance swap tend to be more positive, that is, real- ized VRP falls. [Table 1 about here.] Table 2presents out-of-sample R-squared values obtained from OLS predictive regres- sions, following Welch and Goyal (2008). As seen, all three volatility measures exhibit a positive and signi\ufb01cant OOS R-squared, indicating their ability to predict next-month realized variance asset returns in a meaningful manner. [Table 2 about here.] Figures 1,2, and 3sort the time-series of variance swap returns (RVt+1 V IX2 t\u22121) into \ufb01ve port- folios respectively based on previous month\u2019s realized volatility ( RVt), implied volatility 10(V IX t), and GARCH(1,1)\u2019s one-month volatility forecast ( GARCH (1,1)t). These exercises are similar to Moreira and Muir (2017) Figure 1. As seen, the message is consistent across different volatility measures. First, average variance swap returns tend to weaken as we move from the \"lowest volatility\" portfolio to \"highest volatility\" portfolio, con\ufb01rming an overall negative volatility-VRP relationship. Second, standard deviation tends to rise. Third, as a result, Sharpe ratio tends to fall in size. Lastly, the probability of a recession monotonically increases. [Figure 1 about here.] [Figure 2 about here.] [Figure 3 about here.] The above evidence all suggests that when volatility increases, VRP tends to fall. Equivalently speaking, volatility assets tend to be priced \"too cheap\" and thus exhibit more positive returns going forward. If follows that there might exist a potential oppor- tunity for timing VRP by reducing negative exposure on volatility assets at such times. In this paper, we consider three variance assets. In our benchmark analysis, we use a one-month variance swap contract. This allows us to consider the longest data sample 1990-2023. Later on, we extend our analysis to include VIX futures and S&P 500 straddles as alternative variance assets. Note that the speci\ufb01c trading rule for each variance asset is different and can impact portfolio returns. We start by de\ufb01ning our timing strategies. 2.2.2 Timing Portfolio De\ufb01nitions Similar to Moreira and Muir (2017), our strategy consists of two assets: a variance asset and a risk-free asset. In all three cases (variance swap, VIX futures, or straddle), we 11determine the weight in the variance asset, denoted as wi t, at the end of each month t. Speci\ufb01cally, we set it as wi t=\u2212cft, (2.3) where cis a positive scaling constant chosen in such a way that the portfolio has the same unconditional return variance as the stock market index. The variable ftrepresents a timing factor that ideally demonstrates a positive relationship with conditional V RP t= 1\u2212Et[RVt+1] V IX2 t, which signi\ufb01es the relative expensiveness of variance assets.",

A negative (positive) value of wvs timplies that we have short (long) positions. The second term means that our entire capital Wtcan be allocated to the risk-free rate since variance swap positions do not require any upfront payment to initiate. The third equality follows from a de\ufb01nition of monthly variance swap return in 12terms of notional values: rvs t+1\u2261RVt+1 V IX2 t\u22121. (2.5) Consider then the case of VIX futures. In futures trading, the margin requirements tend to be relatively small, so for the purpose of this analysis, we will ignore the margin requirements. In this case, our portfolio return realized in month t+1, in excess of the risk-free rate, is equal to rt+1\u2212rf t=Wtwvix tPvix t+1 Pvix t+Wt(1\u2212wvix t)(1 + rf t) Wt\u22121\u2212rf t =wvix t(1 +rvix t+1) + (1 \u2212wvix t)(1 + rf t)\u22121\u2212rf t =wvix t(rvix t+1\u2212rf t) =\u2212cft(rvix t+1\u2212rf t). (2.6) The numerator in the \ufb01rst line still represents our month t+1 gross payoff. The \ufb01rst and second terms respectively indicate that we divide the total wealth Wtinto VIX futures and risk-free assets according to the weight (wvix t,1\u2212wvix t). Note that the last term in equation (2.6) is slightly larger than the last term of equation ( 2.4) given the same variance asset return. The difference re\ufb02ects the fact that when we short sell VIX futures, our margin account immediately receives cash in\ufb02ows that can be allocated to risk-free assets. Note that the second line follows from a de\ufb01nition of monthly VIX futures return: rvix t+1\u2261Pvix t+1 Pvix t\u22121, (2.7) where Pvix trepresents the value of a one-month constant-maturity VIX futures portfolio or ETF. Consider then the case of straddles. In options trading, particularly options short selling, margin requirements are typically substantial and cannot be ignored. The mar- gin requirement for options short selling is usually equal to 100% of the proceeds from 13short selling, plus a portion that is proportional to the level of the underlying asset price adjusted by the option\u2019s moneyness. In Johnson (2017), a margin requirement equal to the short selling proceeds plus 20% of the current S&P 500 level is assumed when short selling an at-the-money (ATM) SPX straddle. In this case, our portfolio return realized in month t+1, in excess of the risk-free rate, is equal to (for negative weight wst t) rt+1\u2212rf t=Wtwst tPst t+1 20%\u00d7SPX t\u2212Wtwst tPst t 20%\u00d7SPX t(1 +rf t) +Wt(1 +rf t) Wt\u22121\u2212rf t =wst t( \u2212rst,short t+1 \u2212Pst t 20%\u00d7SPX trf t) =\u2212cft( \u2212rst,short t+1 \u2212Pst t 20%\u00d7SPX trf t) ,(2.8) which has a similar form as the last terms of equations ( 2.4) and ( 2.6), given the same variance asset return, apart from the risk-free rate term. The numerator in the \ufb01rst line still presents our month t+1 gross payoff. The \ufb01rst term indicates that we short sell straddles with a total margin requirement that is equal to a fraction wst tof our capital Wt. When wst t is negative, the \ufb01rst term is negative, representing the payment to close short positions. The second term is positive, representing the additional interest earned on short selling proceeds. The third term represents interest earned on our capital Wt, which entirely can be allocated to the risk-free rate, noting that even the capital maintained as margin earns interest.",

We start with variance swaps as the variance asset, which allows us to have a relatively long data sample back to 1990. Table 3provides a summary of the various ftwe consider and their respective performance. It is important to de\ufb01ne a benchmark portfolio. In our benchmark portfolio, we main- tain a constant weight on variance swaps each month, ft=const .Dew-Becker, Giglio, Le, and Rodriguez (2017) show that one-month variance swaps exhibit signi\ufb01cantly higher re- turn volatility compared to S&P 500. In our sample, the return volatility is approximately 66% per annum. Consequently, in order for the constant-weight portfolio to match the return variance of S&P 500, the weight assigned to the variance swap should be relatively small, close to -0.066 in our sample. Consistent with Dew-Becker, Giglio, Le, and Rodriguez (2017), we \ufb01nd that the mean return on variance swaps in our sample is -31% monthly. With an exposure of -0.066, the resulting mean portfolio return is roughly \u22120.066\u00d7 \u221231% = 2% monthly, or 24% an- nualized. As seen in Table 3, the benchmark constant-weight portfolio already delivers a substantial mean excess return (24% annually) and Sharpe ratio (1.54 annually). Al- though the portfolio returns exhibit larger negative skewness, kurtosis, and maximum drawdowns compared to the S&P 500, these statistics remain at reasonable and accept- able levels. In the long run, the constant-weight portfolio signi\ufb01cantly outperforms S&P 500 (see Figure 5). Since in recent decades, S&P 500 outperforms Fama and French (2015) 5 factors and momentum, it follows that the constant-weight portfolio also outperforms 15Fama-French 5 factors and momentum (not reported). We also regress portfolio returns onto Carhart (1997) 4 factors. The MKT beta is 0.57, which is less than 1. This implies that the strategy enhances returns while simultaneously reducing risk exposure to the stock market. Further, portfolio returns are also correlated with SMB and MOM. To further enhance portfolio performance, we consider four different ft. The \ufb01rst three strategies are not directly based on VRP, but rather based on different volatility measures. These measures include realized volatility, implied volatility, and a GARCH one-month volatility forecast. The analysis in the last section suggets that our exposure on variance swaps should decrease in volatility. Thus, we respectively set ft= 1/RV t, ft= 1/V IX t, ft= 1/GARCH (1,1)t.(3.1) As shown, all of the three timing portfolios exhibit improved performance compared to the constant-weight portfolio. Speci\ufb01cally, the Sharpe ratio can be enhanced from 1.54 to a maximum of 1.76. The negative skewness, kurtosis, and maximum drawdowns all fall. The improved performance can be naturally attributed to two possibilities. The \ufb01rst possibility is purely mechanical. When there is higher (expected) volatil- ity, the expected payoff of variance swaps increases. By reducing negative exposure to variance swaps during such periods, performance is improved. However, this mechan- ical reason alone is obviously insuf\ufb01cient for two key reasons. First, the results hold even when using VIX as the timing factor, which is directly linked to the price, rather than the expected payoff, of variance swaps. If the mechanical reason were the main driver, we would expect to observe opposite results for VIX-timed portfolios, but this is not the case. Second, leading asset pricing models (such as Bollerslev, Tauchen, and 16Zhou (2009),Drechsler and Yaron (2011),Wachter (2013),Dew-Becker, Giglio, Le, and Rodriguez (2017)) all suggest that when volatility rises, the VRP should increase, with variance asset prices rising more than expected payoffs. To boost performance, we would therefore need to increase our negative exposure to variance swaps, but instead, we ob- serve the opposite effect.",

        "content": "The second reason is that, as shown in Cheng (2019), among others, when volatility increases, VRP puzzlingly decreases: variance swap prices increase less than expected payoffs. By reducing negative exposure to variance swaps during these periods, perfor- mance is enhanced. Cheng (2019) shows that the negative volatility-VRP relation holds no matter which volatility measure to use. This is precisely consistent with what we \ufb01nd: the timing portfolios improve performance more or less equally no matter which volatil- ity measure to use. We therefore believe that the second reason is the primary driver of improved performance. As seen from Table 3, various timing strategies further help reduce MKT beta, suggesting an even lower exposure to systematic market risk. [Table 3 about here.] Johnson (2017) and Cheng (2019) develop VRP timing portfolios based on ex-ante VRP measures. As a comparison, we also introduce a strategy that directly incorporates a VRP measure as the timing factor. To estimate VRP, in each month, we estimate a VAR model with two variables ( RVt, V IX t) and \ufb01ve lags, utilizing all available historical realized and implied volatility data. The inclusion of implied volatility ( V IX t) as a model input is motivated by our belief that it contains information about the expected future realized volatility ( Et[RVt+1]). We use volatility measures instead of variance measures as model inputs, as we believe VAR-type models better capture the dynamics of volatility, which can be more gradual compared to the sharp movements of variance. We \ufb01nd that this VRP-based timing strategy also signi\ufb01cantly improves performance. As a comparison, we also report the performance of stock market buy-and-hold and equity premium timing 17strategies of Moreira and Muir (2017). Figure 4plots each month\u2019s portfolio weight on variance swaps for each strategy, wvs t. Mechanically, our timing strategies enhance performance due to a positive correlation be- tween the month t weight wvs tand the subsequent month\u2019s realized variance swap return RVt+1 V IX t\u22121. By comparing the middle and bottom panels of the \ufb01gure, we can observe a certain degree of positive comovement between these two. Intuitively, when volatility spikes in month t, we reduce our exposure to variance swaps (increase wvs t) immediately in month t. Variance swap return realized in month t is already positive and large due to the volatility spike. But since variance swap is typically underpriced in month t, when next month t+1 arrives, payoff is typically higher than the price, resulting in another large positive return, con\ufb01rming the pro\ufb01tability of our strategy. [Figure 4 about here.] This predictive correlation is further directly con\ufb01rmed by Table 4. Additionally, Table 5presents the contemporaneous correlation between the weights adopted in different strategies. As shown, there is a notable level of similarity among them. The strategy based on VRP exhibits a relatively lower correlation with the strategies based on volatility measures. [Table 4 about here.] [Table 5 about here.] Figure 5displays the cumulative portfolio value for each strategy, with all portfolios starting with an initial value of $1 in January 1992. The ending value of each portfolio in November 2023 is also provided. As we can see, the cumulative effect over this 30- year period is huge, with the GARCH-timed portfolio, for instance, generating an almost three-times ending value than the constant-weight portfolio. 18[Figure 5 about here.] Additionally, Figure 5illustrates the drawdowns for each strategy. Moreira and Muir (2017) demonstrate signi\ufb01cant improvements relative to market buy-and-hold, primarily due to the tendency of the equity premium to decline after a volatility spike occurs during recessions. Their strategy sharply reduces the weight on the market index in such times, helping to mitigate further losses or expedite the recovery of values from economic down- turns. As a result, drawdowns become smaller in recessions. Our logic is similar. After a volatility spike in recessions, VRP tends to decrease. Consequently, we signi\ufb01cantly di- minish the negative weight on variance swaps. This serves to prevent further losses or expedite the recovery of values from economic downturns. As a result, drawdowns also become smaller in recessions. These patterns are evident from Figure 5when examining events such as the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. 3.1.1 Where is the improved performance exactly generated?",

        "content": "To better understand where the improved performance is exactly generated, we partition our data into two regimes: a high-volatility regime and a low-volatility regime. We clas- sify a month tas belonging to the high-volatility (low-volatility) regime if realized volatil- ity (RVt) exceeds (falls below) the 80th percentile of its unconditional distribution, approx- imately 20. Table 6performs regression analyses conditional on low-volatility ( RVt<20) and high-volatility ( RVt>20) regimes. Conditional on each regime, we regress timing portfolio excess returns onto contemporanous constant-weight portfolio excess returns: rvs,f t\u22121 t \u2212rf t\u22121=\u03b1+\u03b2(rvs,cw t\u2212rf t\u22121) +\u03b5t, (3.2) forft={1/RV t,1/IVt,1/GARCH (1,1)t}. We can see two patterns. First, the timing port- folio\u2019s alpha relative to constant-weight portfolio is mostly due to high-volatility regimes. Second, the timing portfolio\u2019s exposure to constant-weight portfolio is much lower in 19high-volatility regimes. These two observations both suggest that our VRP timing port- folios perform better in high-volatility times than in low-volatility times. Our exercise is similar to Moreira and Muir (2017) which decompose portfolio performance into ex- pansions and recessions, and \ufb01nd that volatility-managed portfolios reduce exposure to MKT more greatly in recessions. Our choice of low versus high-volatility regimes is mo- tivated by Yang (2022) which shows that the negative volatility-VRP relation puzzle is predominantly observed in high-volatility periods, not necessarily recessions. [Table 6 about here.] We further provide detailed regime-conditional predictability evidence in the Appendix. We \ufb01nd that, aligning with the view in Yang (2022), only large \"structural\" volatility spikes predict negative realized VRPs in the next month, while small volatility shocks in stable periods essentially predict positive VRPs. Our \ufb01ndings thus help differentiate theories on the puzzling negative risk-return rela- tions in the volatility asset market. Cheng (2019) suggests the puzzle is possibly driven by changes in hedging demand induced by microstructure frictions or government\u2019s implicit guarantees when volatility turns high. Lochstoer and Muir (2022) explain the puzzle with extrapolative volatility expectations. Yang (2022) attributes the puzzle to investors\u2019 slow and consecutive learning about underlying large structural breaks in volatility. An under- lying break (such as those caused by Gulf War, Dot-com Bubble Burst, Global Financial Crisis, and European Debt Crisis) occurs in month t and then lasts for several months. Investors do respond sharply, but not sharply enough. Investors\u2019 volatility expectation and pricing of volatility assets consecutively rise. It thus appears that month t+1 realized VRP is negative (i.e., month t+1 volatility asset returns are more positive). Our \ufb01ndings seem to support the channel of Yang (2022). Finally, we note that the above analysis in this section is conducted in an ex-post con- text. In an ex-post examination of portfolio performance, we \ufb01nd that the enhancement 20is driven by periods of large volatility spikes. While one might be tempted to think that a regime-dependent timing strategy can be developed, ex-post \ufb01ndings do not automati- cally suggest a straightforward method to enhance ex-ante timing strategies, due to sev- eral fundamental challenges. We explain these challenges in the Appendix. Consequently, in practice, we prefer to adopt simple timing strategies. 3.2 Shorter OOS Periods: Aug 2006 - Nov 2023 It appears from Figure 5that the outperformance of different timing strategies compared to the constant-weight portfolio is primarily driven by the \ufb01rst half of our sample period. We conduct a robustness check by considering only the second half of our sample as out- of-sample test periods. Table 7provides a summary of the performance for each strategy, while Figures 6and7illustrate the portfolio weights and cumulative portfolio values for each strategy. In this analysis, all portfolios start with an initial value of $1 in August 2006, with the ending value of each portfolio in November 2023 also displayed. [Table 7 about here.] Remarkably, we \ufb01nd that timing strategies based on VIX, GARCH volatility forecast and VRP estimated using the VAR model continue to signi\ufb01cantly enhance performance compared to the constant-weight portfolio. From Figure 7, we can clearly see that during both the 2008 Crisis and the COVID-19 Crisis, our timing portfolio helped contain losses and accelerate value recovery relative to a \ufb01xed-weight portfolio. [Figure 6 about here.] [Figure 7 about here.] Lastly, it is worth noting that the GARCH volatility forecast represents a particularly robust and powerful timing factor for the VRP.",

        "content": "Its superior ability to predict the VRP is 21particularly strong during recent 15 to 10 years. This remarkable performance prompts us to consider the underlying reasons behind its ef\ufb01cacy. One possibility could be the changing dynamics of market volatility driven by breaks in macroeconomic factors, mar- ket structure, or trading patterns. GARCH is better able to capture structural breaks, which has rendered the relationship between volatility and VRP more favorable to the GARCH-based forecasting approach. 3.3 Robustness: Using Actual Price Data Up until now, we have utilized VIX-squared as an approximation for the price of a vari- ance swap contract. However, recent literature, such as the work by Martin (2017), raises concerns about the accuracy of this approximation, particularly when volatility exhibits jump-like behaviors. To address this issue, we incorporate actual OTC quoted variance swap price data provided by Dew-Becker, Giglio, Le, and Rodriguez (2017). This limits our analysis to a relatively shorter period, from 1996 to 2013. First, we observe a high correlation of 98.7% between the realized return on a one- month variance swap, when based on (i) VIX-squared and (ii) the actual price data. The difference between the two is quite negligible. Second, when examining the out-of-sample test results in this scenario, as presented in Table 8and Figures 8and9, we continue to \ufb01nd that various timing strategies demonstrate improvements compared to the constant- weight portfolio. For instance, Sharpe ratios can be enhanced from 1.26 to a maximum of 1.66. All of the other statistics also improve. [Table 8 about here.] [Figure 8 about here.] [Figure 9 about here.] 223.4 Transaction Costs Up to this point, we have not factored in transaction costs in our analysis. It is impor- tant to note that our portfolios are constructed by holding a one-month variance swap contract to maturity each month. Given the low trading frequency, transaction costs asso- ciated with frequent rebalancing are unlikely to have a substantial impact on our portfolio performance. Furthermore, even if transaction costs were substantial, they would likely have a sim- ilar impact on both a constant-weight strategy and, say, a VIX-timed strategy. The key distinction between the two strategies lies in the weighting scheme, with the former main- taining constant weights while the latter adjusts the weights based on VIX each month. But because the average weights are similar across the two strategies (for instance, Table 3shows that average weights for all the strategies, including the constant-weight strategy, are close to -7%), whether the transaction costs are \ufb01xed or proportional (such as bid-ask spread), they would likely affect the two portfolios similarly. To see this, assume that, for instance, the bid-ask spread implies that the shorting return on the original one-month variance swaps is reduced by 1% per month, from 31% to30%. Then, the return on the constant-weight and VIX-timed portfolios will both reduce by 1%\u00d70.07 = 0 .07% per month or 0.07%\u00d712 = 0 .84% per annum. The transaction cost, therefore, does not affect the relative performance between these two portfolios. Note a signi\ufb01cant difference between the volatility asset timing in the current paper and the stock market index timing in Moreira and Muir (2017). In Moreira and Muir (2017), the stock market index is an asset that can be held for a long term. Thus, the more frequently or drastically one adjusts the weight on the market index in the volatility-timed portfolios, the worse the volatility-timed portfolio will perform relative to market buy- and-hold. In contrast, volatility assets all have limited maturities.3We need to rebalance 3Indeed, any non-dividend asset with a stationary price process cannot have unlimited maturity. Oth- 23whether our portfolio has constant or time-varying weights. Thus, transaction costs are unlikely to affect the relative performance between the two portfolios. This logic applies to variance swaps, as well as VIX futures and S&P 500 straddles that we consider below. Considering these facts, we can reasonably expect that transaction costs, whether sig- ni\ufb01cant or not, are unlikely to sharply dampen the relative performance of our timing strategies relative to the constant-weight benchmark. This relative performance is this pa- per\u2019s focus. In the next, we consider exchange-traded volatility assets and explicitly take another form of transaction costs, the margin requirements, into account.",

        "content": "4Portfolio Performance: VIX Futures and S&P 500 Straddles We now consider using two exchange-traded assets, VIX futures and S&P 500 straddles, as the volatility asset. An important transaction cost in exchange trading is the margin requirement, which limits investors\u2019 ability to take positions. For VIX futures, we do not consider margin requirements for two reasons. First, margin requirements for futures trading are typically small. Second, there exist ETFs such as SVIX which provides in- vestors a \ufb01xed negative exposure to constant-maturity VIX futures at minimum fees. For straddles, we explicitly consider margin requirements. 4.1 VIX Futures Unlike our previous exercise with one-month variance swap contracts, VIX futures and S&P 500 straddles do not have regular monthly maturities. To address this, the literature typically constructs portfolios on a daily basis using a front-month contract and a back- month contract, appropriately weighted to achieve an average maturity of one month. We \ufb01rst obtain daily returns provided by Johnson (2017) for the constant-maturity VIX erwise, investors can immediately create an arbitrage strategy by buying low (slightly below the uncondi- tional average) and selling high (slightly above the unconditional average) using limit orders. 24futures/S&P 500 ATM straddle positions with a target maturity of one month, denoted as rm,m +1/21. We then roll over these strategies each month to convert the daily returns into monthly returns rm,m +1: 1 +rm,m +1=21\u220f j=1( 1 +rm+j\u22121 21,m+j 21) . (4.1) Figure 10illustrates the time series of monthly returns on the three volatility invest- ments we consider. Table 9displays the correlation between them. While these returns exhibit strong positive correlations, they are not perfectly correlated. Notably, the aver- age negative returns are more pronounced for variance swaps relative to VIX futures and straddles. [Table 9 about here.] [Figure 10 about here.] To assess the most recent periods, particularly the Covid Crisis periods, we supple- ment the VIX futures and straddle returns obtained from Johnson (2017) with data pur- chased from CBOE and OptionMetrics. This allows us to extend our sample to the most recent time. Table 10presents a summary of our results for VIX futures. As shown, the constant- weight portfolio generates a Sharpe ratio of 0.61, which by construction is equal to the (negative) Sharpe ratio of the original VIX futures portfolios. Our \ufb01ndings therefore align closely with those in Eraker and Wu (2017). In their study, they report an annualized return of -40% and an annualized standard deviation of\u221a 252\u00d74% = 64% for one-month constant-maturity VIX futures portfolios, implying a Sharpe ratio of -0.63. Our timing portfolios, on the other hand, can enhance the Sharpe ratio to as high as 0.78. All the other statistics also improve. The most notable improvement is in the Carhart (1997) 4- factor alpha, from 3.1% (statistically insigni\ufb01cant) to 6.3% (statistically signi\ufb01cant). 25[Table 10 about here.] Plus, as shown in Table 11, we continue to \ufb01nd that the timing portfolios generate positive alpha and reduce exposure relative to constant-weight portfolios mostly in high- volatility regimes. In low-volatility regimes, the timing portfolios even increase rather than reduce exposure, evidence again consistent with \"no low-premium response puzzle\" in low-volatility periods. In sum, ex-post, our timing strategies simply work signi\ufb01cantly better in high-volatility periods. [Table 11 about here.] Figures 11and12plot the portfolio weights and cumulative portfolio values, respec- tively, for VIX futures-based portfolios. In this analysis, all portfolios start with an initial value of $1 in April 2004, with the ending value of each portfolio in November 2023 also displayed. Over this nearly 20-year period, the GARCH-timed portfolio, for instance, generates nearly twice the value of the constant-weight portfolio. From Figure 12, we can again clearly see that during both the 2008 Crisis and the COVID-19 Crisis, our timing portfolio helped contain losses and accelerate value recovery relative to a \ufb01xed-weight portfolio. This explains the smaller drawdowns. [Figure 11 about here.] [Figure 12 about here.] Cheng (2019) implements a \"Cash or Short\" timing strategy, where all portfolio capital is allocated to a short VIX futures contract (subject to margin constraints) each day if the estimated ex-ante VRP (Q minus P) is positive, and to a cash account otherwise. The portfolio is then scaled to having a similar unconditional return variance as S&P 500.",

Although our strategy involves monthly rebalancing instead of daily rebalancing given that there are VIX fu- tures ETFs directly available to investors, we \ufb01nd that the results are highly comparable. For the VAR strategy, we observe a Sharpe ratio of 0.98, an excess return of 15% (both annualized), and a maximum monthly drawdown of -25.4%. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 12, the VAR-VRP timing strategy shows poorer per- formance during the more recent 2016-2023 period. In contrast, the simpler timing strat- egy based on volatility measures, such as GARCH forecasts, performs markedly better in recent periods.

Our \ufb01ndings align with previous studies by Carr and Madan (1998),Coval and Shumway (2001),Er- aker (2021), and Eraker and Yang (2022), which all suggest that a reasonable range for the Sharpe ratio of S&P 500 near-ATM straddles is between -0.4 and -1. [Table 12 about here.] As shown in the table, our timing portfolios have the ability to improve the Sharpe ra- tio from 0.51 to a maximum of 0.62. Although the improvement may be relatively smaller compared to the VIX futures case, it highlights the robustness of our timing portfolios, even after accounting for margin constraints. Plus, Table 13again shows that the timing portfolios generate positive alpha and re- duce exposure relative to constant-weight portfolios mostly in high-volatility regimes. In 27low-volatility regimes, the timing portfolios even increase rather than reduce exposure, evidence consistent with \"no low-premium response puzzle\" in low-volatility periods. [Table 13 about here.] In Table 12, we report two average portfolio weights. First, the weight wtde\ufb01ned in equation ( 2.8), which measures the fraction of month-t total capital that is deposited as margin. Because the margin requirement is usually higher than the market value of the straddles we can trade, wtdoes not measure our portfolio\u2019s real exposure to percent price movement in straddles. Second, the modi\ufb01ed weightwtPst t 20%\u00d7SPX tmeasures the true exposure. As seen, the true exposure is much smaller, on average from -0.12 to -0.14. Figure 13plots the time series of the two portfolio weights for various strategies. [Figure 13 about here.] Figure 14plots cumulative portfolio values for various strategies. In this analysis, all portfolios start with an initial value of $1 in Jan 1996, with the ending value of each portfolio in Dec 2022 also displayed. Over this 27-year period, the VIX-timed portfolio, for instance, generates nearly twice the value of the constant-weight portfolio. From Figure 14, we can again clearly see that during both the 2008 Crisis and the COVID-19 Crisis, our timing portfolio helped contain losses and accelerate value recovery relative to a \ufb01xed- weight portfolio, explaining the smaller drawdowns. [Figure 14 about here.] Johnson (2017) considers a strategy where each day, he buys (sells subject to margin requirements) one-month S&P 500 ATM straddles if \"slope\" (the second principal com- ponent) of VIX term structure falls within the lowest (highest) 20% of historical realized \"slopes.\" Presumably, the effectiveness of this strategy may be in\ufb02uenced by the initial 28OOS time period, which impacts the historical distribution of realized \"slopes.\" Differ- ently, our approach relies on simple volatility measures and exhibits robustness across various subsamples. 5Conclusion We develop VRP timing strategies that are analogous to equity premium timing strategies based on realized volatility, as in Moreira and Muir (2017). Our strategies involve trading two assets: a variance asset and a risk-free asset. To begin, we examine a benchmark port- folio which sells a \ufb01xed weight of variance asset each month.",

        "content": "While this simple strategy already delivers remarkable long-term returns, we show that the portfolio\u2019s performance can be signi\ufb01cantly enhanced by incorporating various timing factors, including several volatility measures and an ex-ante VRP measure. We \ufb01nd the simple volatility-managed strategies are particularly effective and robust. Our \ufb01ndings remain robust in both older and recent times and across three variance assets: variance swaps, VIX futures, and S&P 500 straddles. Our \ufb01ndings are unlikely affected by bid-ask spreads and hold after ac- counting for margin requirements. Our portfolios improve performance by reducing negative exposure to variance assets once observing an increase in volatility. Essentially, we exploit the puzzle of the negative volatility-VRP relationship, which has been highlighted in several previous studies such asCheng (2019). Notably, we \ufb01nd that, ex-post, various timing portfolios generate posi- tive alpha and reduce beta/exposure to constant-weight variance asset portfolio returns almost only during high-volatility regimes, not in low-volatility regimes. Our such \ufb01nd- ings are consistent with Yang (2022) which estimates a regime-switch model and \ufb01nds that the puzzling negative volatility-VRP relation is mostly driven by volatility-spikes. However, we also note that the performance analysis is conducted in an ex-post con- text. Ex-post \ufb01ndings do not automatically suggest a straightforward method to enhance 29ex-ante timing strategies, mostly because volatility spikes are hard to predict. We leave the exploration of regime-conditional timing strategies for future research.

Figure 15illus- trates the coef\ufb01cients and t-statistics from the unconditional OLS predictive regressions using the whole sample. We draw upon three variance asset returns (variance swaps, VIX futures, and straddles) and two volatility measures: RV and IV. As observed, the negative or weak relationship between month-t volatility and month-t+1 realized VRP is mainly driven by the occurrence of large negative realized VRP in month-t+1, which is typically associated with large volatility spikes in month t. In other words, the puzzling negative predictive relation is driven by a bunch of \"outliers\" located in the lower right corner of the graph. [Figure 15 about here.] In Figure 16, we plot the predictive regression coef\ufb01cients and t-statistics conditional on the absence of such large spikes in month t as well as month t+1. Notably, once we isolate away the in\ufb02uence of these large spikes, all the predictive relationships exhibit sta- tistically positive signs. We conclude that, in long-lasting stable periods, small volatility shocks positively predict realized VRP in the next month. [Figure 16 about here.] The above evidence of course corroborates our own \ufb01ndings that volatility-managed variance asset portfolios exhibit much stronger performance during high-volatility regimes (see Tables 6,11and13). The enhanced performance of our timing portfolios relative to the original variance assets is essentially driven by a small bunch of \"outling\" periods. This is the case for all three variance assets. Finally, we note that the above analysis is conducted in an ex-post context. In an ex- post examination of portfolio performance, we \ufb01nd that the enhancement is driven by 34periods of large persistent spikes. While one might be tempted to think that a regime- dependent timing strategy can be developed, ex-post \ufb01ndings do not automatically sug- gest a straightforward method to enhance ex-ante timing strategies. One fundamental challenge is that it is dif\ufb01cult to predict random occurrence of a large volatility spike, which, once occurring, immediately results in large negative real- ized VRPs. During low-volatility periods, where volatility and risk premia exhibit small movement, these substantial negative realized VRPs stand out as outliers that can swiftly attenuate away the positive relations between volatility and next-month realized VRPs (that should have been seen in stable periods). In fact, this is the main reason why we did not observe an increasing pattern of VRPs with volatility levels across the \ufb01rst sev- eral \"low-volatility\" portfolios when following Moreira and Muir (2017) to sort portfolios based on the current month\u2019s volatility levels (see Figures 1,2, and 3).",

        "content": "The positive re- lations between VRPs and volatility levels are attenuated away due to the occurrence of random rare large volatility spikes in the subsequent month, which the portfolio sorting method does not account for. Thus, we conclude that although we observe that ex-post portfolio performance is predominantly driven by persistent large volatility spikes, this does not necessarily im- ply that there is an easy way to leverage this pattern to enhance ex-ante timing strategy performance. Thus, in practice, we prefer to adopt simpler timing strategies. 35Table 1.

Weshowthatsimpleexplicittrading rules can be derived even for general nonparametric alpha and liquidity signals, and also discuss extensions to several impact decay timescales. These results are illustrated using a proprietary dataset of CFM metaorders, which allows us to calibrate the levels, concav- ity, and decay parameters of the price impact model and analyze their effects on optimal trading. 1.Introduction Trading costs play a central role in designing and implementing quantitative trading strategies. Indeed, Loeb (1983) refers to them as the \u201ccritical link between investment information and results\u201d; 40 years later Harvey et al. (2022) still write that \u201cmarket impact costs are a crucial component of strategy performance \u2013 yet these costs are routinely ignored in most academic research studies.\u201d For sizable funds, the crucial concern is their trades\u2019 adverse price impact .1It is well known that impact is concave in trade sizes, in that large trades have a smaller impact than predicted by a linear model and are instead better described by a \u201csquare-root law\u201d.2Price dislocations are also not static but gradually dissipate over time.3 E-mail address :natascha.hey@ladhyx.polytechnique.fr, iacopo.mastromatteo@cfm.com, jmuhleka@ic.ac.uk, kw3058@columbia.edu . Date: November 6, 2023. The authors are grateful to Jean-Philippe Bouchaud for fruitful discussions. 1For instance, Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz (2018) use proprietary data of AQR, a major quantitative fund, to estimate their trades\u2019 price impact. They find price impact costs to be an order of magnitude larger than other costs such as the effective bid-ask spread. These results align with many other practitioner studies. For instance, Nasdaq\u2019s \u201cIntern\u2019s Guide to Trading\u201d (Mackintosh, 2022) also finds price impact for institutional trades to be an order of magnitude larger than spreads. 2Cf., e.g., Loeb (1983); Hasbrouck (1991); Hasbrouck and Seppi (2001); Lillo et al.

There is a large and active literature that studies optimal trading with price impact but, for tractability, these studies typically either assume price impact to be linear (G\u00e2rleanu and Pedersen, 2013, 2016) or to decayinstantaneously(Almgren,2003). Incontrast, formodelswithnonlinearandtransient price impact, even basic qualitative properties such as the absence of price manipulation are typically poorly understood (Gatheral, 2010). A notable exception is the model of Alfonsi, Fruth, and Schied (2010) (henceforth AFS), where an optimal execution problem is solved explicitly. The present study shows that the AFS model, with nonlinear price impact and im- pact decay, also admits closed-form solutions for general statistical arbitrage problems with arbitrary alpha signals and stochastic liquidity parameters.4For capacity- rather than risk-constrained traders,5this yields simple and intuitive trading rules that apply to gen- eral nonparametric price and liquidity forecasts in a straightforward manner, bypassing the need for any brute-force optimization. We also show how to fit models of this type to a pro- prietary dataset of metaorders. This bridges the gap to the empirical literature by allowing to capture the main stylized facts present in the data while retaining inherent tractability of optimal trading strategies. We derive our theoretical results by a change of variables to \u201cimpact space\u201d, where the trader\u2019s control variable is the aggregate impact of their current and past trades rather than the position held. This change of perspective was pioneered by Fruth, Sch\u00f6neborn, and Urusov (2013) for linear impact models.",

        "content": "Here we show that this approach also allows one to reduce the analysis of general AFS models to simple pointwise optimizations, that in turn lead to closed-form expressions for the optimal trading rules. An auxiliary benefit of the method is the derivation of sharp conditions to rule out price-manipulation strategies.6 Finding such practical, measurable, and implementable conditions guaranteeing the good behavior of live trading algorithms is another core concern of execution teams at major financial institutions. The passage to impact space is crucially tied to the existence of a one-to-one map be- tween holdings and the corresponding impact. This is guaranteed when impact decays at a constant exponential rate as in Obizhaeva and Wang (2013). However, many empirical studies find price impact to decay over multiple timescales not captured by a single expo- nential rate, cf., e.g., Bacry et al. (2015); Brokmann et al. (2015). To incorporate this, we show that our approach can be extended to price impact models with multiple decay timescales. The core idea is to switch to impact space and optimize pointwise separately on each timescale, but simultaneously enforce a consistency constraint that the respective impacts correspond to the same trades. The optimal impact state is then again available in closed form, up to solving an autonomous \u201cdecoupling\u201d ODE for the constraint\u2019s Lagrange multiplier. 4Stochastic liquidity parameters are a tractable proxy for the \u201clocal concavity\u201d of the price impact of individual trades (Muhle-Karbe et al., 2023), which can in turn be aggregated into the analysis of impact\u2019s \u201cglobal concavity\u201d at the metaorder level in the present study. 5Busse et al. (2020) show that capacity constraints are a concern even for mutual funds, forcing them to reduce their rebalancing frequencies and shift investments to more liquid instruments. 6Gatheral(2010)firstdefinedandstudiedpricemanipulationconditionsforaclassofpriceimpactmodels. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4625040TRADING WITH CONCAVE PRICE IMPACT AND IMPACT DECAY 3 To illustrate the relevance of our modeling choices and explore the implications of our results for optimal trading strategies, we complement this theoretical analysis with a de- tailed empirical study on proprietary Capital Fund Management (CFM) metaorder data. Specifically, we fit impact levels, concavities, and magnitudes for AFS models across multi- ple decay timescales. This bridges the gap between sophisticated nonparametric empirical studies (which are difficult to translate into optimal trading strategies) and the stochastic control literature (which often studies models lacking empirical foundation). A model with two impact timescales (one fast and one slow) generally offers the best tradeoff between ac- curacy and parsimony. For the corresponding concavities, the best power-law specification is close to a square-root law across all timescales. Using our theoretical results, optimal trading strategies taking into account all of these empirical features can be derived in a straightforward manner. Figure 1 illustrates this. The left panel plots the optimal peak impact ITat the end of the trading interval [0,T]against the corresponding optimal order size QT. This illustrates that square-root concavities in the AFS model indeed generate the square-root law for metaorder impact observed empirically. The right panel of Figure 1 displays the temporal evolution of the optimal impact state It during and after the completion of the trading period [0,T]. During the trading period, impact builds up as the alpha signal at hand is gradually exhausted. For the fast and slow impact decay timescales calibrated in our empirical analysis, a substantial proportion of the peak impact at the end of the trading period then decays very quickly, but the remaining long-term impact lingers much longer.

Metaorder data is proprietary and often difficult to access for academic researchers or small trading firms. Therefore, we also analyze to what extent our fitting results can be recovered from the public trading tape, using \u201cproxy metaorders\u201d constructed from the aggregate order-flow imbalance. These proxy metaorders generally underestimate the magnitude of price impact. For models with a single timescale for impact decay, the public tape allows to recover similar values for decay timescales and concavities, but proprietary metaorders are required to correctly pin down multiple decay timescales correctly.",

To give a non-technical introduc- tiontoouroptimaltradingrulesandillustratetheeasewithwhichthesecanbeimplemented in practice, we now discuss a concrete application, \u201cTransaction Cost Analysis\u201d (TCA).7 The primary purposes of TCA are to establish, ex-post, whether a set of orders traded optimally and to investigate inconsistent behavior. The European Commission (2014) de- fines MiFID II requirements for best execution in Article 27: \u201cObligation to execute orders on terms most favourable to the client\u201d: \u201c[Regulators] require investment firms who execute client orders to monitor the effectiveness of their order execution arrangements and execution policy in order to identify and, where appropriate, correct any deficiencies.\u201d TCA uncovers incorrect model assumptions, algorithm implementation errors, or poorly calibrated alpha signals. Moreover, researchers and traders must communicate TCA to stakeholders, including investors, clients, and regulators: \u201c[Regulators] require investment firms to be able to demonstrate to their clients, at their request, that they have executed their orders in accordance with the investment firm\u2019s execution policy and to demonstrate to the com- petent authority, at its request, their compliance with this Article.\u201d Therefore, TCA must streamline communication, conveying core algorithm trade-offs with- out getting lost in implementation details, or conversely, obfuscating best execution require- ments. The optimal trading formula in this paper fulfills these requirements by expressing the optimal strategy as a balance between impact, alpha, and alpha decay. To illustrate this, first suppose for simplicity that liquidity is constant over the trading horizon. If (a) price impact decays over a timescale \u03c4, (b) price impact is a power function of order size with exponent c\u2208(0,1], and (c) the trader\u2019s alpha signal is \u03b1twith alpha decay \u2212\u03b1\u2032 t, then the impact Itof the optimal trading strategy satisfies the linear relationship (1.1) It=1 1 +c/parenleftbig\u03b1t\u2212\u03c4\u03b1\u2032 t/parenrightbig. At any given time, an algorithm thus reacts to signals by trading in a direction that balances these three core variables. For instance, an execution algorithm accelerates when detecting larger alpha decay. Concavity of the impact function ( c <1) simply implies that alpha signals can be traded more aggressively than for linear impact. For example, the optimal impact state with square root impact exhausts two thirds of the alpha signal, rather than half in the linear case. We now outline how to use the simple relationship (1.1) for TCA; throughout, we focus on the empirically most relevant case c= 1/2where the impact function is consistent with the square-root law. The Baseline Scenario. Firstconsideratraderexecutingorderswithaconstantalphasignal \u03b1t=\u03b1.

From an execution perspective, the trader\u2019s first-order question is:8 Are the strategies correctly balancing alpha and impact? Given our baseline assumptions, strategy C did not balance correctly its alpha and impact: it paid too much impact and should have traded more slowly because I >2 3\u03b1. Of course, traders should take care when translating such inconsistencies into actions. Indeed, the model quickly and intuitively detects inconsistencies within a trading strategy. However, without further analysis, it is unclear which of the trader\u2019s assumptions is false: (a) Did the strategy experience alpha decay during the execution? (b) Is the price impact model incorrect? For example, did liquidity vary during the execution? (c) Is there a code or data error in the execution algorithm\u2019s implementation?",

A trader that is unhappy with strategy C\u2019s low profitability during earnings events, 10bps on 90bps of alpha, may nevertheless not want to completely turn off the strategy. Therefore, they may further decompose the strategy\u2019s performance to determine when it may recover a more comfortable profitability. Table 3 breaks down the earnings news bucket considering whether liquidity was con- stant, rising, or dropping. Section 4.2 extends the balancing formula (1.1) to consider such dynamic liquidity conditions. The table is consistent with the formula, quantifying the following trading intuition: (a) The strategy\u2019s alpha level matters more when liquidity decreases. (b) The strategy\u2019s alpha decay matters more when liquidity increases.

Outline. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the price impact model, and Section 3 formulates the corresponding risk-neutral stochastic control problems. Sec- tion 4 describes the explicit optimal strategies that can be obtained by changing variables to \u201cimpact space\u201d, and Section 5 extends this method to multiple impact decay timescales. These theoretical results are complemented by the empirical analysis in Section 6, where the models are fit to proprietary trading data. For better readability, the derivations of the results are collected in the appendix. Notation. Throughout, we fix a filtered probability space (\u2126,F,(Ft)t\u2208[0,T],P)with finite time horizon T >0.

To formalize this, let(St)t\u2208[0,T]be the \u201cunaffected\u201d (or \u201cfundamental\u201d) mid-price process in the absence of trading. If (Qt)t\u2208[0,T]denotes the holdings of one (or several) large trader(s), the observed market mid-price is Pt(\u03c9,Q) =St(\u03c9) +It(\u03c9,Q). Here, the notation stresses that St(\u03c9)describes price changes that happen independent of the large trader\u2019s actions, e.g., due to external news. In contrast, the price impact term It(\u03c9,Q)can depend both on external randomness andlarge traders\u2019 present and past ac- tions (Qs)s\u2208[0,t]. (We now suppress the dependence on the random state \u03c9\u2208\u2126as usual.) Alfonsi, Fruth, and Schied (2010) (henceforth AFS) proposed a price impact model that captures the nonlinear and transient nature of price impact (cf. the references in the intro- duction) while remaining analytically tractable:9 Definition 2.1 (AFS price impact model) .The price impact of a strategy (Qt)t\u2208[0,T]is It=h(Jt). Here, the impact function h\u2208C2is increasing, odd, and concave on [0,\u221e). Its argument dJt=\u22121 \u03c4tJtdt+\u03bbtdQt, J 0= 0, is an exponential moving average of current and past trades. The timescale (\u03c4t)t\u2208[0,T]over which impact decays and the push factor (\u03bbt)t\u2208[0,T]can be time dependent and random.",

If, more generally, the price impact function his smooth and concave on [0,\u221e), then small trades dQtstill have approximately linear impact dIt=h\u2032(Jt)\u03bbtdQt, but the overall impact of large trades Qtis sublinear in line with the crossover from linear to square-root impact documented empirically by Bucci et al. (2019b). Indeed, as trades and in turn the moving average Jtaccumulate, the linear impact h\u2032(Jt)\u03bbtdQtbecomes smaller by concavity of the impact function h(x). This also leads to sublinear impact for metaorders that are executed gradually over time (large block trades evidently have a direct sublinear impact). Remark 2.2. Obizhaeva and Wang (2013) motivated their linear price impact model with a flat limit-order book. Analogously, nonlinear price impact functions can be derived from a limit order book with non-constant density (Alfonsi et al., 2010; Carmona and Webster, 2019). The connection between the order book and price impact is that the order book maps prices to marginal trading volumes. When one derives the price impact model from an order book shape,Jmeasures a trade\u2019s volume impact on the order book. The exponential moving average corresponds to the \u201cresilience\u201d of the order book, which gradually recovers due to new incoming limit orders. One then uses the order book shape to map this volume impact back to a price impact. 9Alfonsietal.(2010)leveragethistractabilitytosolveanoptimalexecutionproblem. Inthepresentstudy we show that statistical arbitrage problems with general alpha signals and stochastic liquidity parameters also admit closed-form solutions. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=46250408 TRADING WITH CONCAVE PRICE IMPACT AND IMPACT DECAY Note, however, that the impact function h(x)cannotsimply be read off the cumulated state of the current order book. Instead, at lower frequencies, it is a reduced form model for thelatent order book (T\u00f3th et al., 2011; Donier et al., 2015), which encodes the latent portion of the demand and supply curve that has not yet materialized into the visible order book.

Then, volume impacts smaller than the threshold x0shift prices linearly, whereas the price impact of large trade imbalances scales with the square root of the volume impact. The location and scale parameters in the square root function are chosen to ensure value matching and smooth pasting between these two regimes, compare Figure 2. \u22124\u22122 0 2 4 x\u22124\u22122024h(x) Figure 2.

For simplicity, we focus on a single large trader who controls the holdings (Qt)t\u2208[0,T]. Additional \u201cexternal flow\u201d of other market participants could be added similarly as in Muhle-Karbe et al. (2023), but we do not spell this out here to not overload the notation. 3.1.Self-Financing Equation. When the large trader\u2019s holdings vary smoothly, that is Qt=/integraltextt 0\u02d9Qsdsfor a finite \u201ctrading rate\u201d \u02d9Qt=dQt/dt, then trades dQt=\u02d9Qtdtare settled atSt+h(Jt+dQt) =St+h(Jt) +O(dt).

Note that for smooth trades the distinction between the price impact before and after their execution vanishes. This differs for discrete block trades or holdings \u201cwiggling like Brownian motion\u201d.

Here, the trader values their end-of-day position at the unaffected price rather than the mar- ket price. This avoids illusory gains caused by pushing up prices when entering a position. Such illusory mark-to-market gains due to price impact are studied by Caccioli et al. (2012); Kolm and Webster (2023). To avoid such misleading profits, traders minimize arrival slip- page and ignore mark-to-market P&L, in line with (3.1). A helpful statistic to simplify (3.1) is the so-called intraday alpha signal \u03b1t=Et[ST\u2212St] =Et[ST]\u2212St. This signal predicts intraday returns the trader doesn\u2019tcause. For a risk-neutral trader, an alpha signal is a sufficient statistic of the unaffected price St. Indeed, an integration by parts and\u03b1T= 0yieldE[/integraltextt 0QsdSs] =E[/integraltextt 0\u03b1sdQs]for smooth strategies dQt=\u02d9Qtdt.

That is, in expectation, each trade earns alpha but pays price impact. A long-term trader may also have views on returns beyond the trading day. The risk- neutral objective (3.1) can be extended to incorporate such long-term views as follows: Definition 3.2 (Risk-neutral long-term trading) .A risk-neutral long-term trader solves the stochastic control problem sup QE[YT+S\u03c4QT]for some time \u03c4 >T. A risk-neutral long-term trader still tracks an alpha signal \u03b1t=E[S\u03c4\u2212St|Ft], but the end-of-day constraint \u03b1T= 0no longer applies in this case. With this notation, the representation (3.2) of the risk-neutral goal functional still applies. The only difference is that the long-term alpha does not vanish at the end of the trading day. 11This budget equation assumes that trades settle at the mid-price and thus neglects the contribution of bid-ask spreads to transaction costs. As discussed in the introduction, this is justified for large, capacity- rather than risk-constrained actors, for which impact costs dominate spread costs. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=462504010 TRADING WITH CONCAVE PRICE IMPACT AND IMPACT DECAY For simplicity, we henceforth assume that the alpha signal \u03b1tis an It\u00f4 process and denote its drift rate by \u00b5\u03b1 t. Traders typically refer to \u03b1tas thealpha level and to\u2212\u00b5\u03b1 tas thealpha decay. Examples 3.3 and 3.4 below specify standard parametric alpha signals. Example 3.5 covers the increasingly common non-parametric case. In particular, this applies to modern machine-learning approaches to alpha research and showcases the advantage of our explicit trading formulas from Theorem 4.2 for general non-parametric signals. Example 3.3 (Deterministic alpha) .The trading signal \u03b1tcan be deterministic even if the fundamental price Stis stochastic. For instance, a constant drift rate of the fundamental pricedSt=\u00b5dt+\u03c3dWttranslates to the deterministic intraday alpha signal \u03b1t=\u00b5(T\u2212t). In the long-term case, the alpha signal equals \u03b1t=\u00b5(\u03c4\u2212t). Example 3.4 (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck alpha) .If the unaffected price process has It\u00f4 dynamics dSt=\u00b5tdt+\u03c3tdWt, then the alpha decay\u2212\u00b5\u03b1 tequals the drift rate \u00b5t. The most common specification is to model this as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process d\u00b5t=\u2212\u03b8\u22121\u00b5tdt+\u03b7dWt.12 Then, the intraday alpha is \u03b1t=/integraldisplayT tEt[\u00b5s]ds=/integraldisplayT te\u2212(s\u2212t)/\u03b8\u00b5tds= (1\u2212e\u2212(T\u2212t)/\u03b8)\u03b8\u00b5t. For a long-term trader predicting the steady-state alpha ( \u03c4\u2192\u221e), we have\u03b1t=\u03b8\u00b5t. Example 3.5 (Non-parametric alpha) .Examples 3.3 and 3.4 are convenient to derive analytical results. However, practitioners rarely fit two-parameter alpha signals. Instead, they increasingly rely on non-parametric models with hundreds or thousands of features. In particular, the last decade saw the rise of machine learning models for alpha research. For example, cf. Cont et al. (2021); Kolm et al. (2023) for applications of various neural network architectures to build alpha signals from limit order book events. Therefore, most quantitative strategies treat alpha signals as generic functions or pro- cesses. For instance, a portfolio optimization or trading algorithm may abstract away an alpha model\u2019s parameters and rely on a stream of alpha levels \u03b1tand decays\u2212\u00b5\u03b1 t. Solving control problems in this non-parametric regime therefore is a crucial differentiation between toy models and practical algorithms. 4.Solution by Mapping to Impact Space We now turn to the solution of the risk-neutral trader\u2019s optimization problem (3.2). Section 3.2 derives the objective function (3.2) for smooth strategies Qt=/integraltextt 0\u02d9Qsds. This is sufficient when trading signals \u03b1tvary smoothly over time. However, diffusive trading signals as in Example 3.4 naturally lead to diffusive trades.",

Only the volume impact states Jtappear in the reformulation (4.1) of the objective function, but not their derivatives. Hence, this representation of the trader\u2019s expected P&L naturally extends to general strategies with jumps and/or nontrivial quadratic variation.13 Moreover, switching the control variable from the trader\u2019s holdings Qtto the corresponding impact state Jtmassively simplifies the trading problem. Indeed, in impact space, the goal functional can simply be optimized pointwise , circumventing the need for dynamic programming or other advanced methods.14 Theorem 4.2 (Pointwise maximization in impact space) .Suppose the integrand in (4.1)is strictly concave in volume impact Jt. Then, pointwise maximization determines the optimal J\u2217ash(J\u2217 T) =\u03b1Tand (4.3) 0 =\u2212\u00b5\u03b1 t+ (\u03c4\u22121 t+\u03b3\u2032 t)\u03b1t\u2212(\u03c4\u22121 t+\u03b3\u2032 t)h(J\u2217 t)\u2212\u03c4\u22121 th\u2032(J\u2217 t)J\u2217 t,fort\u2208[0,T).

More specifically, we link the concavity of the integrand in (4.1) to the absence of \u201cprice manipulation\u201d (i.e., round trip trades with a positive expected cost). For linear price impact, this link was first established by Fruth et al. (2013), who observed: \u201cTime-dependent liquidity can potentially lead to price manipulation. In periods of low liquidity, a trader could buy the asset and push market prices up significantly; in a subsequent period of higher liquidity, he might be able to unwind this long position without depressing market prices to their original level, leaving the trader with a profit after such a round trip trade.\u201d The same intuition also applies in the present context with concave price impact. Indeed, differentiating twice shows that the integrand in (4.1) is strictly concave in Jtif (4.4) 2\u03c4\u22121 t+\u03b3\u2032 t>maxx/braceleftbigg \u2212h\u2032\u2032(x)x h\u2032(x)/bracerightbigg . 13For linear price impact models, this extension argument first appears in Ackermann et al. (2021). The self-financing condition for general strategies can in turn be backed out in a second step, see Corollary A.2. 14For linear price impact models, this approach has been pioneered by Fruth et al. (2013, 2019). A related change of variable to integrated impact is used by G\u00e2rleanu and Pedersen (2016); Isichenko (2021).

When the impact function his the identity as in Obizhaeva and Wang (2013), then the right-hand side of (4.4) is zero, and this wellposedness condition reduces to the no price manipulation condition from Fruth et al. (2013). For general concave impact functions h, the zero lower bound is replaced by the curvature of the impact function, measured by the \u201cArrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion\u201d of h. This lower bound makes it harder to avoid price manipulation. For example, if hfollows a power law \u221dxc,c\u2208(0,1), then the lower bound in (4.4) is 1\u2212crather than 0.

Indeed, if (4.4)is not satisfied then an explicit price manipulation strategy can be constructed just as in the linear case (Muhle-Karbe et al., 2023, Section 4.3). For general concave impact functions h(x)the global concavity condition (4.4)is only sufficient to rule out price manipulation but not necessary. For example, if the integrand fails to be strictly concave everywhere, then it may still have a unique global maximum, unlike for power law functions. 4.2.Examples. We now discuss the properties of the optimal policies implied by Theo- rem 4.2. Corollary 4.4. Consider the case where the price impact function is a pure power law h(x) =xcforx\u22650.16Under the no price manipulation condition (1 +c)\u03c4\u22121 t+\u03b3\u2032 t>0, the optimal impact state then is (4.5) I\u2217 t=\u03c4\u22121 t+\u03b3\u2032 t (1 +c)\u03c4\u22121 t+\u03b3\u2032 t\u03b1t\u22121 (1 +c)\u03c4\u22121 t+\u03b3\u2032 t\u00b5\u03b1 t. The Baseline Scenario. First assume the general alpha signal to be constant over [0,T]. For instance, the long-term trader determines their alpha signal at the start of the day and does not update the signal intraday. In particular, the long-term trader assumes no intraday alpha decay. The optimal impact state then equals I\u2217 t=\u03b1 1 +c, t\u2208(0,T);I\u2217 T=\u03b1. The corresponding smooth trades are dQ\u2217 t=\u03b11/c \u03bb\u03c4(1 +c)1/cdt, t\u2208(0,T), and the initial and terminal bulk trades are \u2206Q\u2217 0=\u03b11/c \u03bb(1 +c)1/c; \u2206Q\u2217 T=((1 +c)1/c\u22121)\u03b11/c \u03bb(1 +c)1/c. Unsurprisingly, the optimal trades are a complex non-linear function of the model and the alpha because the price impact model is non-linear. In contrast, when expressed in impact, the optimal trading strategy is a surprisingly concise linear function of alpha. 15In particular, such a solution always exists in the empirically relevant case where the price impact functions behave like a power function xc,c\u2208(0,1]for largex. 16Due to lack of smoothness one cannot apply Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 in this case. However, one can first apply these results to a smoothed impact function as in Example 2.3 and then send the mollification to zero.

Every time one adds model features, boththeoptimaltradesandtheoptimalimpactincreaseincomplexity. However, thetrades\u2019 complexity increases massively. While numerically implementable, these trade formulas are challenging to grasp and communicate concisely. In contrast, the impact formulas increase only mildly in complexity and remain intuitive as one adds model features. Adding Alpha Decay. To illustrate this, now assume that \u03b1tis an It\u00f4 process with drift \u00b5\u03b1 t. The optimal impact state then equals I\u2217 t=1 1 +c(\u03b1t\u2212\u03c4\u00b5\u03b1 t), t\u2208(0,T);I\u2217 T=\u03b1T. Therefore, a trader considering a dynamic alpha signal only needs to correct their strategy in impact space by the alpha\u2019s decay, measured by \u00b5\u03b1 t, relative to the impact decay rate. Furthermore, this adjustment remains linear. Contrastthissimpleexpressionfortheoptimalimpacttothecorrespondingtradingspeed over (0,T). For simplicity, assume \u03b1is deterministic, so that \u00b5\u03b1 t=\u03b1\u2032 t. The optimal trading speed then is dQ\u2217 t=(\u03b1t\u2212\u03c4\u03b1\u2032 t)(1\u2212c)/c \u03bb\u03c4(1 +c)1/c(\u03b1t\u2212\u03c42\u03b1\u2032\u2032 t)dt. Not only does the formula in trade space depend on higher derivatives of the alpha signal, the complexity increase also compounds with the non-linear relationship and leads to an unwieldy trading formula. Alpha Decay and Dynamic Liquidity. With alpha decay ( \u2212\u00b5\u03b1 t>0), one must trade more aggressively to exploit the trading signal before it disappears. We now discuss how this tradeoff between alpha level and decay is modulated by changing liquidity conditions (recall that\u03b3t= log\u03bbt, where\u03bbtis Kyle\u2019s lambda, a measure of illiquidity): (a) When liquidity changes are small, \u03b3\u2032 t\u226a\u03c4\u22121 t, the optimal impact state simply adds the alpha level \u03b1tand its decay\u2212\u03c4t\u00b5\u03b1 tover the impact\u2019s timescale: I\u2217 t=1 1 +c(\u03b1t\u2212\u03c4t\u00b5\u03b1 t). (b) When liquidity decreases by a sizable amount, then the alpha level gains in impor- tance. For instance, if \u03b3\u2032 t=\u03c4\u22121 t, then I\u2217 t=2 2 +c\u03b1t\u22121 2 +c\u03c4t\u00b5\u03b1 t. (c) Conversely, when liquidity increases by a sizable amount, then alpha decay gains in importance. For instance, if \u03b3\u2032 t=\u22121 2\u03c4\u22121 t, then I\u2217 t=1 2 + 2c\u03b1t\u22122 1 + 2c\u03c4t\u00b5\u03b1 t.

Let us now discuss how the results above adapt to more general price impact functions such as the crossover from linear to square- root impact in Example 2.3. To this end, the crucial observation is that the optimality condition (4.3) is local, in that that the optimal impact state only depends on the corre- sponding local behavior of the price impact function. For example, if the impact functions is a concatenation of power laws (up to smooth interpolation), then the corresponding optimal impact state switches between the corresponding power law regimes as the alpha signal, its decay, and the liquidity parameters vary over time. 0 1 2 3 4 5 \u02dc\u03b10.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5I\u2217 Figure 3.

For stronger adjusted alpha signals \u03b1t\u2212\u03c4t\u00b5\u03b1 t>x 0, the nonlinear part of the impact function applies. For very large adjusted alpha signals, the latter approaches a square root function so that the optimal impact state tends to two thirds of the alpha signal. For intermediate values of the alpha signal, the optimal impact state smoothly interpolates between these extreme cases, as illustrated in Figure 3. 5.Optimal Trading with Multiple Decay Timescales Empirical studies have shown that impact decay initially follows a power-law and even- tually converges to a permanent level (Brokmann et al., 2015; Bucci et al., 2019a). To ap- proximate such multiscale dynamics, we now consider a more general version of the model from Section 2, where price impact decays at multiple different exponential timescales (and each of the corresponding concavities can potentially also be different).

For simplicity, we focus on a smooth alpha signal (\u03b1t)t\u2208[0,T]. The price impact of a smooth trading strategy (Qt)t\u2208[0,T]now is the convex combination of Nstandard AFS models, with different time scales for impact decay and, potentially, also different concavities: (5.1) It=N/summationdisplay n=1wnhn(Jn t). Here, the normalized weights satisfy wn\u2208[0,1]with/summationtextN n=1wn= 1, the impact functions hnare increasing, odd and concave on [0,\u221e)(e.g., power laws), and their arguments Jn t are exponential moving averages of current and past trades with different decay timescales \u03c4n>0: dJn t=\u2212\u03c4\u22121 nJn tdt+\u03bbdQt, Jn 0= 0.

For simplicity, we focus on a deterministic alpha signal and constant impact parameters \u03c4n, \u03bb.

Thus, the trading strategy behaves as if it traded under the weighted timescale\u03c4w, plus additional decay terms induced by the Lagrange multipliers. For the special case of linear price impact ( hn(x) =x), the ODEs from Theorem 5.1 become linear, leading to explicit solutions that can be applied to arbitrary alpha signals.17 The simplest case of two impact decay timescales and constant alpha already illustrates several key effects: Example 5.3 (OW model with two timescales) .When price impact is linear ( h1(x) = h2(x) =x), then\u03b7tsatisfies a linearsecond-order ODE.

This \u201ctransient\u201d build-up of the optimal impact state is required to satisfy the trade consistency conditions (5.4), which depend both on the current levels and the histories of the different volume impact Jn tand whence would not be satisfied if the overall impact state would immediately be moved to its stationary level by an initial bulk trade like for a single impact decay timescale. With a finite trading horizon T <\u221e, a similar smoothening is applied near the terminal time. ThisisillustratedinFigure4fordifferentimpactdecaytimescalesandtradedurations T.

We seek to answer questions such as \u201cWhat timescales does price impact decay over?\u201d or \u201cDo all timescales share the same concavity parameter?\u201d Given the difficulty of accessing sufficiently large metaorder datasets for academic researchers or small trading firms, we also quantify to what extent price impact models fit on proprietary data can be recovered using the public trading tape alone. 6.1.Dataset. Researchers calibrate price impact models on various datasets to analyze transaction costs at the order or portfolio level. Data may include proprietary orders at large financial institutions (Almgren et al., 2005; Bershova and Rakhlin, 2013; Toth et al., 2017; Frazzini et al., 2018), and public trades on the market tape (Bouchaud et al., 2004; Cont et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2019; Muhle-Karbe et al., 2023). In this paper, we use a proprietary dataset of meatorders provided by CFM that comprises roughly 105metaorders of future contracts traded over 2012-2022. The time at the start and the end of each meta- order is indicated, as well as the mid-price and the number of child-orders. All meta-orders were executed through at least three child-orders and accounted for a fraction between 0.01% and 10% of the average daily volume; the average order size was of the order of 0.1%. No meta-order was traded longer than one day and the average execution time is 3h. In line with Almgren et al. (2005), we normalize trade sizes dQtby the average daily traded volume of the respective contracts.

To implement the fitting, for each value of the concavity cnand impact timescales \u03c4non the parameter grid, we then compute the respective volume impacts state hn(Jn t), and in turn fit their coefficients wnby a linear regression. The optimal values of the concavity and decay parameters are in turn determined by optimizing over the grid.20 Together with our results from the previous sections, this allows researchers to fit non- linear, multi-timescale models while retaining inherently tractable solutions to statistical arbitrage problems with general nonparametric alpha and liquidity signals. Furthermore, this grid-search provides a sensitivity analysis across different parameter values as a byprod- uct. 6.3.Summary of Results. Table 4 summarizes our parameter estimate across various model specifications. The following sections then delve deeper into different aspects of this analysis. The main takeaways of our analysis of the \u201cterm structure of metaorder impact\u201d are: (a) Two timescales fit the data well. In order of economic importance, these are a fast timescale measured in hours and a very slow timescale measured in weeks (resem- bling permanent impact). (b) Concavity is uniform across all of these timescales, in line with the square-root law. When the aggregate order flow imbalance is used to create \u201cproxy metaorders\u201d from the public trading tape (see Section 6.6 for more details), then the main takeaways are: (a) When restricted to models with one timescale, public and proprietary data retrieve thesameconcavitiesandsimilardecayparameters. However, thepublictradingtape substantially underestimates the magnitude of price impact. Taken at face value, this model misspecification can in fact turn the P&L of an otherwise profitable strategy negative, compare Hey et al. (2023). 18For simplicity, we focus on constant liquidity parameters. See Cont et al. (2013); Min et al. (2022); Muhle-Karbe et al. (2023) for empirical studies with dynamic liquidity parameters using the public trading tape. 19For power impact functions, the push factor \u03bbnof each volume impact JN tcan be absorbed into the unnormalized weights, so we set \u03bbn= 1without loss of generality. 20A nonparametric approach for estimating general decay kernels for linear price impact is proposed and studied by Neuman et al.

We now look into the fitting of multiple impact decay timescales in more detail. Two timescales: To show that impact decays on multiple timescales, we start by fitting two decay timescales \u03c41,\u03c42while keeping the same concavity parameter c1=c2= 0.5fixed. Figure 6a displays a symmetric heatmap of the statistical sensitivity to (\u03c41,\u03c42). TheR2 peaks at \u02c6\u03c41= 0.5days, matching the one-dimensional decay fit in Hey et al. (2023). Figure 6d fixes \u03c41= \u02c6\u03c41and displays R2(\u02c6c,\u02c6\u03c41,\u03c42). Three peaks appear at 7,14and65 days, allowingtosignificantlyincreasethefractionofexplainedvariance: despitethemodest absolute change (from 2.65% of price variance up to 2.75%), the change is significant \u2013 for our sample size, the standard error of R2(\u02c6c,\u02c6\u03c41,\u03c42)is5\u00b710\u22125. The largest improvement obtains for the longest timescale \u02c6\u03c42= 65days, with associated weight w2= 0.3. (As for principal component analysis, we henceforth sort the timescales by descending weights wn.)",

        "content": "This slow impact decay effectively corresponds to permanent price impact. Using the ANcerno database, Bucci et al. (2019a) show that permanent impact is about 1/3 of peak impact.

The main plot shows the statistical fit. The inset panel displays the normalized weights of the third timescale. 6.5.Understanding Multiple Concavities. We now lift the assumption that \u02c6c1= \u02c6c2= 0.5and explore arbitrary combinations of concavity parameters (c1,c2). The essential take- away is that varying concavity over timescales does not significantly improve the model for metaorder data. More specifically, we now fix the two timescales \u02c6\u03c41,\u02c6\u03c42with the largest weights obtained above, but vary the corresponding concavities c1,c2. Figure 8 displays the statistical fit for different concavity parameters in the left panel. The heatmap is asymmetric: (a) For the longer timescale, \u02c6c2= 0.5regardless of the choice for c1. (b) For the shorter timescale, \u02c6c1<0.5. For example, for \u02c6c2= 0.5we obtain \u02c6c1= 0.45, cf. Subfigure 8b. However, comparedtothepreviouscasewhereonechoosesthesameconcavityparameterfor both decays, the statistical significance R2increases only slightly by 5\u00b710\u22125from 2.752%to 2.759%, comparable to the standard error 5\u00b710\u22125of theR2. Therefore, multiple concavities only lead to relatively minor improvements in the model fit. 6.6.Understanding the Public Trading Tape. Metaorders are proprietary data and are not typically available to academic researchers. Trading firms (especially small ones) may also wish to compare their proprietary trades with the market. Therefore, we now assess to what extent similar results as in the previous section can also be derived from the public trading tape alone. Many trades on the public tape belong to metaorders and, thus, are expected to have the same price impact. However, the challenge is that the public tape lacks additional metaorder information such as start and end times or even average durations. To gain a better understanding of how the impact of the aggregate public orderflow compares to metaorders, the aggregate impact ITcan be computed over a bin of length Tconditional on the orderflow imbalance/summationtextNT t=1\u2206Qtwhere \u2206Qtis the traded quantity (normalizedbyaveragedailyvolume)ofthe tthtradeoutof NTtotaltradesintherespective bin.

The proxy metaorders cover the same assets as the proprietary metaorder. We construct them to last for 3 hours each to match the average proprietary metaorder length. We also experimented with 30s metaorders, but find that this leads to quite different results. Figure 9 collects calibration results for the public trading tape. The essential takeaway is that, when fitting a single timescale using comparable metaorder durations, the public trading tape recovers the same concavity and a similar decay timescale as the proprietary dataset. The public trading tape substantially underestimates the magnitude of price im- pact, which is problematic for implementing trading strategies. Nevertheless, for academic research, these results suggest that proxy metaorders allow one to obtain parameter esti- mates of a reasonable magnitude. This is no longer the case when fitting multiple timescales and concavities: (a) The public trading tape struggles to capture long-term decay. Therefore, the ad- ditional metaorder information crucially matters when discussing permanent (or slowly decaying) price impact. (b) For the public trading tape, different timescales seem to have different concavities. In particular, the square-root law does not hold universally, but shorter timescales appear more linear and longer timescales more concave, unlike for metaorder data.

In summary, our empirical study based on metaorders suggests that a model with square-root impact across two timescales presents a good compromise between parsimony and accuracy.",

        "content": "In order of importance, the decay timescales are of the orders of hours and weeks. For models with a single timescale, the public trading tape recovers the correct concavity and a reasonable estimate of the fast impact decay but underestimates the magnitude of the price impact. The longer-term impacts are difficult to extract from public data, and the public data also points towards deviations from the square-root law that cannot be found in the metaorder data. This clarifies the scope and the limitations of using publicly available trading data as a proxy for proprietary metaorders. Appendix A.Proofs for Section 4 We first establish the myopic representation of the goal functional in impact space from Theorem 4.1. Recall that we are still focusing on smooth trading strategies Qt=/integraltextt 0\u02d9Qsds at this stage. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=462504026 TRADING WITH CONCAVE PRICE IMPACT AND IMPACT DECAY Proof of Theorem 4.1. With the one-to-one change of variables dQ=\u03c4\u22121 te\u2212\u03b3tJtdt+e\u2212\u03b3tdJt, the goal functional to be maximized in (3.2) can be rewritten as (A.1) E/bracketleft\uf8ecigg/integraldisplayT 0(\u03b1t\u2212h(Jt))\u03c4\u22121 te\u2212\u03b3tJtdt/bracketright\uf8ecigg +E/bracketleft\uf8ecigg/integraldisplayT 0(\u03b1t\u2212h(Jt))e\u2212\u03b3tdJt/bracketright\uf8ecigg . The first term is already in a form that can be maximized pointwise in Jt. We now recast the second term in such a form, too. To this end, notice that It\u00f4\u2019s formula gives e\u2212\u03b3T\u03b1TJT=\u2212/integraldisplayT 0e\u2212\u03b3t\u03b3\u2032 t\u03b1tJtdt+/integraldisplayT 0e\u2212\u03b3t\u03b1tdJt+/integraldisplayT 0e\u2212\u03b3tJtd\u03b1t (becauseJ0= 0andQtas well asJtand\u03b3tare smooth). Moreover, It\u00f4\u2019s formula, J0= 0 and the smoothness of Jtyield e\u2212\u03b3TH(JT) =/integraldisplayT 0e\u2212\u03b3t\u03b3\u2032 tH(Jt)dt+/integraldisplayT 0e\u2212\u03b3th(Jt)dJt. By substituting these two identities, the second term in (A.1) can be rewritten as E/bracketleft\uf8ecigg \u2212/integraldisplayT 0e\u2212\u03b3tJtd\u03b1t+/integraldisplayT 0\u03b3\u2032 t\u03b1tJtdt\u2212/integraldisplayT 0e\u2212\u03b3t\u03b3\u2032 tH(Jt)dt+e\u2212\u03b3T\u03b1TJT\u2212e\u2212\u03b3TH(JT)/bracketright\uf8ecigg =E/bracketleft\uf8ecigg/integraldisplayT 0e\u2212\u03b3t/parenleftbig\u2212Jt\u00b5\u03b1 t+\u03b3\u2032 t\u03b1tJt\u2212\u03b3\u2032 tH(Jt)/parenrightbigdt+\u03b1TJT\u2212H(JT)/bracketright\uf8ecigg . Together with the first term in (A.1), this yields the asserted myopic representation (4.1) of the goal functional in impact space. \u25a1 The next step is the observation of Ackermann et al. (2021) that, in impact space, the goal functional can be readily extended continuously to the impacts generated by general, not necessarily smooth strategies. Proposition A.1 (Continuity of the objective function in impact space) .The functional in impact space /integraldisplayt 0e\u2212\u03b3s/parenleft\uf8ecig (\u03c4\u22121 s+\u03b3\u2032 s)(St\u2212Ss)Js\u2212\u03c4\u22121 sh(Js)Js\u2212\u03b3\u2032 sH(Js)/parenright\uf8ecig ds+/integraldisplayt 0e\u2212\u03b3sJsdSs\u2212e\u2212\u03b3tH(Jt). is continuous in the volume impact (Jt)t\u2208[0,T]generated by general semimartingale strategies with respect to the Hilbert norm ||J||2=E/bracketleft\uf8ecigg/integraldisplayT 0e\u2212\u03b3tJ2 tdt+e\u2212\u03b3TJ2 T/bracketright\uf8ecigg . Having constructed the goal functional for general non smooth trading strategies in im- pact space by continuous extension, one can back out the corresponding self-financing con- dition in a second step. Unlike for smooth strategies, bulk trades or holdings with nontrivial quadratic variation are no longer settled at the impact before the trade. Instead, additional It\u00f4 and jump correction terms appear. Corollary A.2 (Continuous extension of the self-financing equation) .For general semi- martingale trading strategies (Qt)t\u2208[0,T]with volumeimpact (Jt)t\u2208[0,T], the goal functional (4.1) Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4625040TRADING WITH CONCAVE PRICE IMPACT AND IMPACT DECAY 27 in impact space corresponds to the self-financing equation Yt+QtSt=/integraldisplayt 0Qs\u2212dSs\u2212/integraldisplayt 0h(Js\u2212)dQs\u2212/integraldisplayt 0\u03bbs 2h\u2032(Js\u2212)d[Qc]s \u2212/summationdisplay s\u2264t/parenleft\uf8ecig 1 \u03bbsH(Js)\u22121 \u03bbsH(Js\u2212)\u2212h(Js\u2212)\u2206Qs/parenright\uf8ecig . Here, the first term corresponds to the usual gains and losses due to exogenous price changes. The second term takes into account that all (even smooth) trades incur the price impact already in place when they are executed. The third term is an It\u00f4 correction for diffusive trades.21The last term takes into account the extra impact of bulk trades.22 A.1.Proofs for Section 5. Proof of Theorem 5.1. The trade consistency constraints (5.4) correspond to the Lagrange penalties \u03bb\u22121/integraldisplayT 0\u03b7n t/parenleft\uf8ecig dJ1 t+\u03c4\u22121 1J1 tdt\u2212dJn t\u2212\u03c4\u22121 nJn tdt/parenright\uf8ecig , where\u03b7n t,n= 2,...,Nare Lagrange multipliers to be determined. Assuming the Lagrange multipliers \u03b7n tare smooth and, in particular, do not jump at the initial or terminal time,23 we can rewrite the Lagrange penalties using another integration by parts as (A.2) \u03bb\u22121\u03b7n T(J1 T\u2212Jn T) +\u03bb\u22121/integraldisplayT 0/parenleft\uf8ecig (Jn t\u2212J1 t)\u03b7\u2032 t+ (\u03c4\u22121 1J1 t\u2212\u03c4\u22121 nJn t)\u03b7t/parenright\uf8ecig dt. Maximizing the goal functional in its Lagrangian form over J1 T,...,JN Tdirectly yields (5.5). Maximizing over J1 t,...,JN tfort\u2208[0,T)gives h\u2032 1(J1 t)J1 t+h1(J1 t) =\u03b1t\u2212\u03c41\u03b1\u2032 t+1 w1N/summationdisplay n=2(\u03b7n t\u2212\u03c41\u03b7n\u2032 t), h\u2032 n(Jn t)Jn t+hn(Jn t) =\u03b1t\u2212\u03c4n\u03b1\u2032 t\u22121 wn(\u03b7n t\u2212\u03c4n\u03b7n\u2032 t), n = 2,...,N. This in turn leads to (5.6) as well as (5.7). We now turn to the characterization of the Lagrange multipliers that guarantee that the trade consistency constraints (5.4) hold.",

Locally, this is analogous to the accounting in the linear model of Obizhaeva and Wang (2013), but with a smaller extra price impact when price dislocations are already large. 22The third component of this term cancels the jumps of the stochastic integral/integraltext h(Js\u2212)dQs. The extra impact cost of a bulk trade \u2206Qtthus is the average1 \u03bbt/integraltextJt Jt\u2212h(x)dxalong the price impact function. One can show that this coincides with the costs for such jump trades in the limit-order book model of Alfonsi et al.

Lerman, Elizabeth Bell Abstract: The evolution of market economies has dramatically broadened the opportunities of consumers, workers, investors, and firms. Financial services have become especially free and accessible, but also increasingly complex. For the new financial freedom to help most people, they must understand their choices and the likely implications of alternative decisions. Unfortunately, many Americans have a weak grasp of basic personal finance principles. This paper emphasizes the importance of financial literacy in an increasingly complex market economy and examines the current state of financial education in the U.S. and abroad. We explore two methods of delivering financial kn owledge\u2014through broad financial curriculums and through more focused \u201cteachable moments.\u201d After examining the pros and cons of each, along with the evidence about their effectiveness, we suggest that a combination of the two perspectives, with the specific topics and behavioral strategies varying by target audience. We conclude by calling fo r a more rigorous evaluation of the effects of existing programs. About the Authors: Robert I.

Lerman Elizabeth Bell The evolution of market economies has dr amatically broadene d the opportunities of consumers, workers, investors, and firms. The sh eer variety of goods and se rvices that are easily accessible (for a price) would be breathtaking to people living just a century ago. At the same time, the multitude of choices can be bewildering. Increasingl y, taking best advantage of available opportunities places heavy demands on the ability of actors to make sensible choices. The rising complexity affects nearly all mark et decisions, from choices about food, whether consumed at home or in restaurants; to c hoices about clothing, el ectronic equipment, transportation, and housing; to choices about career pathways; and to choices about savings and investing. Viewed in this light, the widening array of a lternatives in the financial marketplace is part of the larger process operating in the economy as a whole. Nonetheless, financial decisions are particularly vexing to many of today\u2019s families and to many business people as well. Perhaps the confusion has arisen because of the speed at which financial markets and new financial instruments have emerged or because of the highe r levels of sophistica tion and the longer time horizons required for sound financ ial decisions. Moreover, the a dded complexity is taking place just as households face increased responsibilitie s for financial decisions and for insuring their own financial well-being. As lengthening life spans are maki ng retirement planning a higher * This paper was presented at \u201cAssessing Financial Literacy and Why It Matters,\u201d a conference sponsored by Networks Financial Institute at Indiana State Univ ersity.",

The expanding availability of credit options is providing individuals with more capacity to invest in education and owner-occupied housing and to separate the timing of consumption from the timing of income. At the same time, bad decisions can mire households in debt and l ead to much lower livi ng standards than they could afford had their financial d ecisions been more sensible. For the new financial freedom to help most people, it is essential that they understand their choices and the likely impli cations of alternative choices. Unfortunately, many Americans have a weak grasp of basic personal finance pr inciples. One survey covering overall financial concepts found that nearly two-th irds of American adults and students did not know that money loses its value in times of inflation. General at titudes towards spending and saving behavior are troubling as well. Results from another survey re vealed that only a quarter of Americans feel very well informed about managing househol d finances (Jump$tart 2004). Low-income families are especially vulnerable to misinformation. What is lacking is not information (who is charging what? ), but ra ther the ability to interpret the information (how well do alternative mortgages strategies fit my needs?). Many people even seem unable to recognize the high futu re burden they will experience by borrowing at very high interest rates. Without knowing all of the circumst ances of individual cases, it is difficult to determine how many people are ma king very poor decisions. But, given the apparently weak financial knowledge of a larg e segment of the popula tion, the high rates of consumer bankruptcy, and the large share of the population poorly prepared for retirement, there are reasons for concern. 3Financial Education and Financial Literacy Programs Recognizing the importance of knowledge about financial decisions, a number of public agencies, private foundations, school systems, a nd employers have begun to sponsor financial literacy programs. The Congress passed the Title V of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act (FACT Act), which established the Financia l Literacy and Education Commission with the purpose of improving the financial literacy and e ducation of persons in the United States. The US Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Financ ial Education is the lead agency charged with coordinating financial literacy efforts within the ex ecutive branch of the Federal government. The Federal Reserve Board posts a great deal of material that pr ograms and individuals can use to foster financial education relating to bank accounts, consumer credit, mortgages, leasing vehicles and personal finance. In addition, Fe deral Reserve banks around the country sponsor education programs on a variety of topics, incl uding the Money Smart program, created by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Some private financial institutions target clients or potential clients. Visa and the American Bankers Association offer financial education programs free to educators, consumers, and bankers. The Jump$tart Coalition focuses on students, while the National Community Reinvestme nt Coalition tries to reach low-to-moderate income people. Some financial education prog rams are attached to other asset-building initiatives, such as home ownership programs (Braunstein and Welch 2002) and savings programs like Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) for low-income individuals (Schreiner, Clancy, and Sherraden 2002). The concerns over insuring adequate financial literacy are not unique to the US. Recently, the OECD (2005) published a report, Improving Financ ial Literacy , that defines financial education, examines the state of fi nancial knowledge in various countries, assesses 4financial education for retirement saving and credit and debt, and s uggests future directions. The report finds that financial literacy is a widesp read problem, reaching mo st countries, certainly those on which there are reliable data (Japan, Korea, Australia, and the US). Although many countries have financial education programs, few have been well evaluated (for a US overview, see Lyons et al 2005).",

        "content": "The report also points out that, in some cases, financial education should not be the only tool for improving financial deci sions. Affecting some decisions can require countering such behavioral factor s as inertia and lack of will power with automatic mechanisms, like automatically enrolling individuals in pension programs unless they opt out. Financial Education in High Schools The returns to a well-designed financial edu cation program might be quite high. If a one semester course at the high school level\u2014or ab out 10 percent of a year\u2019s schooling\u2014led to only a 0.5 percent improvement in financial well-being, the returns would rival the 6-7 percent rates of returns to earnings from a fu ll year of schooling. One likely and unusually unnoted side effect of financial education is the improve d job readiness of students. Financial literacy proponents often see hi gh school students as one of the most appropriate populations to educ ate. Mandatory at tendance makes student s a captive audience and, importantly, a young one. Ingr aining savings behavior in stud ents might well decrease the financial mistakes they may make later in life . High school curriculums provide a ready-made infrastructure for reaching a wide audience with relative ease (at least compared with community groups and other organizations, which need to sp end some effort reaching out to their intended populations (Morton 2005)). And few dispute the gap in financia l education of students. The need for financial education among these students, according to avai lable data, is great. A Visa USA 2004 survey found that 56% of parents belie ve that high school graduates are \u201ctotally 5unprepared\u201d to manage their personal finances responsibly; another surv ey found that only 20% of teens think that their knowle dge of money management is either good or excellent; and another reports that only 35% of students say they learn about money management in school (Jump$tart 2005). Average financial litera cy scores on the Jump$tart survey of 12th graders declined from 1997 to 2004. Surprisingly, scores va ry little with ownershi p of securities, with having a bank account, and with the extent to which students discuss money matters with parents. Partly in response to these trends, public school curriculum requirements have increased over time. As of 2004, forty-ni ne states required economics in their curricular standards and fifteen states required that stude nts take an economics course to graduate. Thirty-eight states reported the mandatory inclusion of personal finance standards, while seven of these states made personal finance a graduation requirement. Despite these increased efforts, questions remain about what share of high school students are exposed to financial education programs and whether such programs lead to increased financial knowledge or more responsible financial beha vior. Much of the short-run analysis of financial education among high school students has been conducted by Lewis Mandell of the University of Buffalo, who mana ges the Jump$tart surve y. Among other results, Mandell (2005) examined the relationship betw een financial literacy programs, financial knowledge, and saving behavior. He found th at financial education and experience do not appear related to financial literacy, what he calls a \u201c\u2026very disheartening result, particularly among financial educators who believe that a solu tion to the problem of financial illiteracy is personal finance education, particularly if it is standardized, mandated and tested\u201d (2005 p. 7). 6 Other evidence suggests a more optimistic pict ure. According to an evaluation of the High School Financial Planning Program sponsored by the Nati onal Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE), students taki ng the program reported signi ficant improvement in their financial knowledge at least up to three months later. Teac her surveys of student knowledge taken before and after the progr am curriculum indicate that st udents improved their knowledge of critical areas, including understanding of the career/income relationship, consumer credit, car insurance, and the time value of money. Mo reover, about 60 percent reported changing their savings behavior (increasing sa vings) as a result of the program (Boyce and Danes 1998). Mixed evidence emerges from another study of financial education impacts.",

The positive impact of financial education on behavior may even persist for a long time. Using surveys of 30-49 year-olds in 1995, Bernhe im, Garrett and Maki (2001) looked at the impacts of the presence and timing of state manda ted financial education requirements. They found the requirements led to more students taki ng financial education an d, subsequently, higher savings and net worth. Self-reported savings ra tes were approximately 1.5 percent higher for students entering a high school grade five year s after the imposition of a financial education mandate than for students not present when this mandate was instituted. Compared to the overall population, the rate of saving out of income for students exposed to the mandate was 4.75 percent higher in the populati on distribution than for those w ho were not. Net worth, albeit much more difficult to measure, increased by ro ughly one year\u2019s worth of earnings for students 7exposed to the mandate, whose net-worth-to-ear nings ratio was also 9 percent higher than students who were not exposed. These surprisingly large impact s suggest that financial know ledge imparted on the young may continue into middle-age. Garrett and Ma ki\u2019s (2001) long-run conc lusions bring a kind of consistency to the Jump$tart survey results\u2014fin ancial education, while not affecting financial knowledge, sometimes affects financial behavior, ev en later in life, when the chances to apply this education through experi ence increase (Mandell 2005a). However, financial literacy levels remain lo w, especially for the less-educated and low- income populations in the US and other count ries (OECD 2005). Survey evidence on both financial education and financia l practices suggests American adults need he lp. In 2004, between 25 and 56 million adults were unbanke d (Jump$tart 2005) and consumer debt is now equal to 110% of disposable income (Jump$tar t 2004). A survey conducted by FleetBoston in 2003 found that only 27% of respondents felt we ll-informed about managing their household finances, and fewer than half felt they were a good role model for th eir children regarding spending and saving (Jump$tart 2005). These results are especially disturbing given the fact that many individuals rely on the ex periences of family and friends to shape their financial knowledge and behavior (see, for example, Horton 2005; Hilgert and Hogarth 2003). The OECD reports that consumers very ofte n feel more confident than their knowledge justifies, implying the need to help consumers to recognize the limits of their information and the desirability of learning more. Perspectives on the Content of Financial Education Programs Since financial education programs seem to raise savings, why not simply expand them? One reason is the naturally uneas y feeling about evidence suggest ing that financial education 8increases savings but does not ra ise financial literac y. If people are no be tter informed about financial matters, why does a class influence th em to save more? Moreover, might weaknesses in knowledge lead to later financ ial blunders in any event? Be fore doing more to promote or require financial education program s, we should develop ways to improve their effectiveness and their accuracy. The flawed nature of some questions on tests of financial literacy is a warning sign about the material being taught.\u2020 We should strive for effective teaching methods of content that is correct, not misleading, an d that will lead to sound deci sions about matters relevant to those taking the courses. But, how do we get there? The first step should be to be clear about the goals of the financial education and pot ential tradeoffs. Is the primary goal to increase financial knowledge or to influence financial decisions? Althoug h ideally financial edu cation programs would achieve both, the approach may vary, dependi ng on which goal we wish to emphasize.",

        "content": "A focus on educational outcomes usually invol ves teaching high school students about an ambitious set of topics and using standardized tests to determine student learning. The list of topics varies from one standard to another, but often includes complex issues such as \u201cdollar cost averaging\u201d and difficult concepts involved in r eading the prospectus of mutual funds. One strength of the approach is that high school studen ts are a captive, nearly universal audience for the education effort. Another is that introducing the concepts at this stage of life may prevent early and long-lasting mistakes and prevent ba d habits from developing. On the other hand, some curricula include lessons that are incorr ect and few teachers are well qualified to teach financial topics to high school students. As noted above, th e evidence suggests that even \u2020 Consider, for example, the following question taken from a poll commisioned by the National Commission on Economic Education (2005). Respondents are asked to complete the sentence, \u201cThe existence of the stock market\u2026\u201d The correct answer from multiple choices is \u201c\u2026 brings people together who want to buy stocks with people who want to sell stocks.\u201d This is either trivial or misleading. 9students completing the programs ha ve little gain in their knowledg e of financial realities. Limited success in the past is no reason to ab andon the effort. Of the many potential topics taught in high school, the basics of economics a nd personal finance should rank very high. But, no one should underestimate the challenge of insu ring teachers are proper ly prepared and that what they teach is properly vetted and sensibly limited to important, accessible topics. A second perspective is to focus directly on the goal of affecting financial decisions and financial outcomes. The emphasis would be on issu es of clear relevance to the students or of relevance in the immediate future. The teaching approach would involve a great deal of hands-on learning and would raise financia l topics as partly a means to personal goals. In discussing retirement issues, the teachers could begin with the payroll stubs of students and explain the rational for FICA taxes and descri be how their (and their employers \u2019) contributions in the form of FICA taxes are part of an in tergenerational compact that will qualify them for a retirement income. A class for high school students could consider financial decisions of likely relevance. A car is an asset most students would like to have and might buy in the near future. The lessons could deal with the costs of car ownership (including gas, upkeep, and insurance), and the benefits of car ownership, the advi sability of financing the car pur chase with credit, the car as a durable good and why credit might make sense in a car purchase but not in borrowing for basic living expenses. The discussion of car insura nce would provide a good opportunity for students to learn broad concepts that have direct applicabi lity to their lives. If well-treated and examined in some depth in which students themselves work out various calculations, one would expect that students will likely to remember and use this information. How to examine the financial consequences of human capital investment and career decisions should be central to any program for high school students. These matters are 10complicated but working out calculations illustrating the potential returns to investing in oneself may be the most important element of financial education. Again, care must be taken to avoid giving students misleading or incorrect informa tion. For example, studies typically report the returns to college among those attending college a nd not the returns to the marginal student. Still, students should see human capital investments as similar to financial investments in terms of meeting living standards over the long-term. The lessons should illustrate why borrowing to fund human capital investments ma y be appropriate, given the durab le nature of increased human capital. We realize that examples of this kind are al ready included in high scho ol curricula.",

        "content": "But, they are too often embedded in long lists of desira ble finance standards that include topics quite distant from the lives of students and quite abst ract. A focused approach on a limited number of highly relevant topics may prove more effective. The general approach of focusing training on real life experiences can and should be extended beyond high schools. Training should consid er a variety of key tr ansition points, such as buying a home, moving out of a parent\u2019s home , taking a student loan, taking a small business loan, and starting a job and facing options for pe nsions and health insurance. Often, programs already exist for providing financial education linke d to such decisions, but they may not reach an important segment of the population. Linking fi nancial training with the timing of decisions takes place in many venues. They include community organizations, employers, welfare programs, credit unions, and, most recentl y, as part of programs offering Individual Development Accounts. Ideally, programs in th ese venues should identify the most important issues that arise at various decision point s and help people avoid mistakes and missed opportunities. 11One extension beyond educating people at decisi on points is to link ed ucation with steps that deal directly with behavior. For exampl e, instead of simply discussing the reasons why people should have bank accounts, programs have made agreements with banks to provide special account options and to sign up people at the site. Other programs take a recess, give bus fare and directions to participants, and have them open accounts at specific moments. Another innovation becoming widely known is the use of de fault options to encourage savings and safe investments. Some employers are enrolling new workers in 401(k) pension programs when they start work and require them to take concrete steps to opt-out of such arrangements. Other approaches involve having people commit in advance to allocating a portion of their future salary increases toward retirement savings. Thaler an d Benartzi (2004) find, in one implementation of this plan through four annual raises, that 78 percen t of those offered the plan joined, that most remained in the plan through the fourth pay raise, and that the average saving rates increased in response to participation by from 3.5 percent to 13.6 percent over the course of 40 months. Although evidence is scanty, some studies have attempted to examine the impact of providing education at these \u201ct eachable moments\u201d (times when people are about to make a specific financial decision). Others have emphas ized behavioral strategi es, especially at key decision points. We now turn to studies of these approaches. Evidence on Effects of Financial Education at Teachable Moments Since experience seems to be an important component of educa tion, linking financial learning to \u201cteachable moments\u201d might well do the most to in crease the knowledge and improve the quality of financial decisions of individuals. Currently, or ganizations are reaching out to individuals and households by providing training based on speci fic transactions, such as 12purchasing a home or vehicle, or applying for credit. For exam ple, 93 percent of banks in a recent Consumer Bankers Association survey repor ted that they require credit counseling when individuals apply for mortgage lending programs (Morton 2005). Employers can also offer financial education in conjunction with participation in a retirement plan. Despite the promising opportunities these progra ms offer, the fact remains that reaching out to individuals or households via the \u201cteachable moments\u201d pl atform is difficult. Since the type of transactions that support \u201cteachable mo ments\u201d education are more oriented towards adults than high school students, th e groups that need financial educ ation are more likely to have very different cultural and financial experience s and work and family demands (Morton 2005). In addition, given the la rge amount of unbanked adults in the United States, a lack of relevant venues may prevent even the most targeted education programs from reaching their ideal audience (Burhouse, Grambell and Harris 2004). One piece of recent evidence for high school seniors calls the \u201cteachable moments\u201d strategy into question.",

        "content": "In a study using the Ju mp$tart surveys, Mandell (2006) compared the responses of students who had taken a course in personal finance with those who had not, grouping the responses of students by whether or not they have had firsthand financial experiences. He examined eleven questions that directly relate to the experiences of high school seniors, such as the use of cr edit and debit cards, vehicle financing, and higher education expenses. He found no systematic relationshi p between course-related improvements in financial knowledge and financial experience, such as having a credit card, a checking account, and a car. Although on some dimensions students with financial experien ce learned more from courses than did the overall youth population, other tested topics (l ike debit cards) either showed mixed results or results that ran against the hypothesis what Mandell calls \u201cJust-in-Time 13Instruction\u201d. Mandell concludes th at, at least for high school student s, \u201crelevance by itself is not the answer\u201d (p. 9a) to improving fina ncial knowledge and/or behavior. But, this conclusion may itself be incorrect . Mandell admits th at we know little or nothing about what was taught in th ese courses. Perhaps, the cour ses did not address the issues appearing on tests or did so in an ineffective manner. Moreover, the questions used to judge knowledge could have varying inte rpretations. For example, cons ider the question \u201cIf you had a savings account at a bank, which of the following w ould be correct concerni ng the interest that you would earn on this account?\u201d The testmakers appa rently view as incorrect the answer that \u201cEarnings from savings account intere st may not be taxed\u201d. In f act, interest earnings for those below the tax threshold (which may be the case for many students) will go untaxed while earnings from work is taxed from the first dollar. Finally, the Ma ndell analysis does not examine whether or not well-executed courses aimed at affecting immediate financial choices and behavior actually do so. Several other studies on targeted counselin g speak more directly to the \u201cteachable moment\u201d hypothesis. Hirad and Zorn (2001), for example, examined data on approximately 40,000 mortgages under Freddie Mac\u2019s Affordable Gold program to determine whether pre- purchase homeownership counseling programs lower mortgage delinquency rates. The authors found that borrowers who receive counseling are about 13% less likely to become 60-day delinquent than borrowers with equivalent charac teristics who did not. While the authors did not examine the affect of counseling on the timing of delinquency or the severity of any loss that may occur, they conclude that pre-purchase ho meownership counseling can increase the success of lending programs. 14 Elliehausen, Lundquist and Staten (2003) expl ored the impact of credit counseling on subsequent borrower behavior. Analyzing te n different measures of borrower credit performance, they came to the conclusion that borrowers who r eceived counseling \u201cgenerally improved their credit profile\u201d over the three years following instruction than similar borrowers who did not undergo counseling. Specifically, counseling had a positive impact on creditworthiness, cultivated improved financial behaviors regarding cred it characteristics like total debt, account balances and bank card usage, and lowered delinquency experiences. Evaluations of workplace programs also s how that financial education positively influences savings. In examining the effects of financial education in the workplace, Bayer, Bernheim, and Scholz (1996) find that participa tion in and contributions to voluntary savings plans increase when employers offer retirement se minars. Further, this effect is even more pronounced in lower-income populations. For lowe r-wage employees, frequent seminars offered with retirement plans result in a participation rate that is 11.5 percent higher than for those plans without seminars. For highly compensated employ ees, there is a 6.4 percent difference. Kim, Kratzer and Leech (2001) supported this finding, noting that employees who received financial education counseling increased th eir 401(k) participation. The e ffectiveness of these programs was likely the result of combining financial e ducation with a direct institutional outlet for applying it. In a study of older individuals, Lusardi (2004) examines the impact on financial and total worth of attending a meeting on retirement or retirement planning organized by his or his spouse\u2019s employer.",

Their net wo rth rises by close to 30 percent as a result of behaviors in response to attending a retirement seminar. 15 Other studies report favorable behavioral results from financial education programs linked to services for low-income households . In an evaluation of the American Dream Demonstration and IDA participants, Schreine r and his colleagues (2002) show that, in conjunction with saving through the IDA program, participants who also took financial literacy courses contributed higher net m onthly savings deposits. In additi on, classes did not need to be very long\u2014the authors report ab out 8 to 10 hours\u2014to take a dvantage of potential savings benefits. Attaching financial literacy programs to ot her welfare programs may be one of the best strategies for reaching the unbanked population, alt hough program participants will still, to some extent, be self-selecting. One study dealing with program impacts on financial literacy examined a program operating in the context of an ex isting social welfare program. The Illinois Department of Human Services, along with the Financial Links for Low-Income People (FLLIP) coalition, recently created personal finance and asset-building programs under the state\u2019s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families syst em. Using the financial education curricula developed by FLLIP, several nonprofit organizati ons offered a free, 12-hour financial education course for Illinois welfare reci pients and adults with child ren under 18 and incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty le vel. The curriculum covered an a rray of topics, from spending choices and understanding credit, debt, and taxes to using financial institutions, insurance, and job benefits. In addition, FLLIP sponsored an IDA program that included a 10-hour financial education course and 6 hours of asset-specific training. A summary eval uation noted that about one-third of participants did not \u201cgraduate\u201d fr om the training program, and that non-completion rates were nearly three times hi gher at the \u201ceducation-only\u201d sites than at the IDA sites. Follow 16up surveys indicated that participants improve d their budgeting, payment, credit card and loan practices (Anderson, Scott and Zhan 2004). Implications for the Future of Fi nancial Education Finance can be a complicat ed subject involving sophistic ated mathematics, a deep understanding of economics, and a recognition that psychological factors influence actual choices in the context of risk. Few can compre hend the complex models that optimize portfolios to achieve the most favorable risk-return tradeo ff. And yet, in modern economies, people must make frequent decisions embodying important fina ncial concepts. They must choose when and how much to borrow, when and how much to sa ve, whether to buy and how to finance purchases of homes and consumer durables, and how to plan for uncertain c ontingencies and for retirement. Of course, the largest impacts of these decision s fall on the individuals making them and their families. However, the general public is often affected as well, because bad decisions will worsen the plight of many families and arouse altr uistic concerns, will require added taxes to care for such families, and will increase external costs, by raising risks and associated interest rates and by requiring more use of legal and other social resources to deal with bankruptcies. While the reliance on individuals to make their own financial d ecisions increasing in most modern economies, the worry is th at too many individuals are ill-pr epared. It is not surprising that many governments are trying to increase th e financial knowledge of their citizens. The question is, what approaches can be st promote financial knowledge and sound financial decisions? A sensible education approach must delineate which skills are necessary for every adult to master, which provide a framework for adults to engage in continuous learning, and which skills require financial specialists. We would suggest selecting a modest number of important topics that all students and adults can learn well instead of trying to deliver an 17ambitious agenda of financial concepts.",

        "content": "Ideally, the selected topics woul d have relevance to the students and would allow for lear ning-by-doing and behavioral appr oaches that not only improve knowledge and but also stimulate people to choose wisely. In our view, the specific topi cs and behavioral strategies should vary with the target group. For example, high school students might focus on the concepts of time horizons, comparing borrowing rates and rates of return, an d common life cycle choices. Applications of these concepts could involve decisions about i nvesting in human capital , including financing requirements; purchasing, financing, and mainta ining a car; and how w ithholding funds from their wages for payroll taxes both transfers funds to the elderly and disabled and helps them qualify for disability and survivors in surance and retirement benefits. Education concerning credit and debt issues can be crit ical for helping people avoid excess indebtedness, mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, bankruptcies and borrowing that is excessively costly. The proliferation of cr edit and debt instruments, often with extensive information from written provisions and salesp eople, can overwhelm borrowers. The OECD (2005) suggests designing at l east two program approaches, one on the basics of budget management and a second, for people who understand credit to some extent, dealing with how to choose among credit instruments. Another suggestio n is to build up the confidence of consumers so they can challenge financial in termediaries about the credit provi sions in various contracts. Doing so will require programs that simply financia l concepts and make them apply to real life situations. One major challenge is how best to develop financial literacy policies for often marginal, \u201cunbanked\u201d members of society. The OECD (2005) points to community-based programs, delivered in informal environments with local trainers, as having the pot ential for drawing more 18low-income people into the financial mainst ream. The report favors trying to convince individuals about the advantages of having a bank account and then following up with direct help for people to set up accounts and with ongoing budget management training. The approach should emphasize preventing mistakes and promo ting long-term learning. One potential problem not addressed in the OECD study is the presence of asset limits in public benefit programs that might discourage savings (see Chen and Lerman 2005). As the US and other countries move forw ard to expand financ ial education and to encourage behavioral change, it is important to develop a serious research and evaluation effort (Lyons et al 2005). There are already large numbe rs of programs offering training in financial literacy. But, which are providing cost-eff ective services, both in terms of improving knowledge and financial decision s? Some experimental studi es have been conducted, but without plans for replicating the findings and diffus ing the activities. The US Department of the Treasury, which has responsibility for improvi ng financial literacy, should partner with foundations, the Federal Reserve, and a few privat e sector organizations dealing with financial literacy to produce a serious research and evaluati on plan linked to long-term goals and actions. The evaluations should include experimental an d non-experimental tech niques and should deal with costs, knowledge impacts, and impacts on behavior. Where appr opriate, the financial education programs should be linke d with other initiatives aimed at helping people achieve a decent living standard. These might include pr ograms aimed at teen pregnancy prevention, marriage and relationship skills training, and preventing criminal behavior. Whether provided alone or in combination with other initiatives, financial literacy programs have the potential to achieve significant and cost-effective improvements in economic welfare. 19References Anderson, Steve, Jeff Scott and Min Zhan. 2004.

In this paper, we endeav- ored to answer this question by conducting a thorough analysis of the profitability of Opening Range Breakout (ORB) strategies, with a particular focus on the 5- minute ORB. Using a large dataset that covered more than 7,000 US stocks traded from 2016 to 2023, the research aimed to assess how effective this strategy was in producing consistent and uncorrelated returns. A new aspect of our study was the focus on Stocks in Play , which are stocks that show higher than normal trading activity on a specific day, mostly because of fundamental news about the company. Our results showed a significant benefit in limiting day trading only to those Stocks in Play (even after considering transaction costs). A portfolio that consisted of the top 20 Stocks in Play achieved a total net performance of over 1,600%, with a Sharpe ratio of 2.81, and an annualized alpha of 36%. Passive exposure in the S&P 500 would have achieved a total return of 198% during the same period. Further- more, this paper expanded the analysis to compare the return profile of the ORB strategy applied to different time frames, such as 15, 30, and 60 minutes. In the last part of the paper, we presented detailed stock-specific statistics for the 25 best and worst performers of an ORB strategy over all the time frames. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public paper with such intraday granularity and comprehensive stock-level database.

With the advent of advanced trading technologies, a flood of information on trading strategies, and the rise of affordable, even free, brokerage services, the landscape shifted dramatically. Now, the majority of Main Street are actively engaging with finan- cial markets. In 2023, 61% of adults in the United States invested in the stock market directly [1]. The 2020 pandemic served as a catalyst in this transformation. Lockdowns and market volatility sparked a surge in retail trading, especially in the stock market [17, 9, 14]. A landmark event was the 2021 GameStop (GME) short squeeze, an extraor- dinary David vs. Goliath tale where retail traders triumphed over Wall Street giants, leading to the dissolution of some professional trading firms [3]. This event symbolized the unleashed power of retail trading, a genie that is definitely not going back in the bottle. Most retail traders gravitate toward day trading or short-term swing trades. But there is a daunting challenge for retail traders who are competing with high-frequency trading (HFT) algorithms. They need access to proven strategies that can give them an edge and consistent advantage in the markets, often with technical analysis. Our previous research had been focused on informing retail traders [22] and developing, testing, and refining day trading strategies that are useful for retail traders without access to the lowest com- mission tiers or HFT capabilities [24, 23]. Over the years, technical traders have developed and documented hundreds of trading systems. Among them, one of the most important and well-studied strategy that has gained considerable attention is the n-minute ORB , with popular variants including 5- minute, 15-minute, 30-minute and 60-minute time frames. As shown conceptually in Figure 1, the ORB strategy typically focuses on identifying the highest and lowest prices during the first n-minutes of trading, and then buying or selling when the stock breaks out of this range only in the direction of the opening range.",

Toby Crabel is often credited with first introducing the ORB (back in 1990)[11]. In his book, Day Trading with Short Term Price Patterns and Opening Range Breakout , which was one of the earliest and most detailed descriptions of how to trade short-term price patterns across markets, he extensively analyzed the profitability of volatility breakout strategies across various futures markets. In his model, the range was calibrated combin- ing previous days\u2019 volatility with current opening prices. The strategy did not use any intraday data information to define the opening range. In the book, Crabel detailed his core trading philosophy, that any robust trading strategy should capture explainable mar- ket participant behavior. Traders must understand the mass psychology of the traders behind the price action. Essentially, traders are social psychologists behind a computer program [12]. Over the years, the ORB strategy has been studied and documented significantly both by market participants [23, 4, 2, 10, 15] and academia [8, 18, 13, 21, 19, 16]. In 1995, Raschke and Connors [10] introduced the Momentum Pinball strategy, a model that im- proves the ORB strategy by combining a 60-minute ORB with a 3-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) of a 1-day rate of change. Their study was tested on different futures mar- kets, but the authors suggested that the same methodology could have been applied to common equity markets. 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4729284In his seminal work in 1992, Brock et al. [8] demonstrated the effectiveness of simple technical trading rules, specifically the moving average and ORBs, applied on almost 100 years of Dow Jones Index data. His findings were pivotal in challenging the random walk hypothesis , a financial theory stating that stock market prices evolve according to a random walk and thus cannot be predicted, and emphasized the potential of techni- cal analysis strategies in market prediction. In 2009, Schulmeister [18] focused on the frequency of data in technical trading. By analyzing S&P 500 data from 1960 to 2000, and the futures market from 1983 to 2000, Schulmeister demonstrated that models using 30-minute interval data were more profitable than those relying on daily data, suggesting a shift toward higher frequency trading in technical analysis. In 2012, Holmberg et al. [13] studied the profitability of volatility ORBs on US crude oil futures prices from 1983 until 2011. Their results showed that a volatility ORB was significantly profitable, but the profitability was mostly generated in the last decade (2000-2011). In 2018, Tsai et al. [19] further expanded the research on ORB strategies by assessing their performance across multiple indices (Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq) and for different opening range time frames. The results showed that the most significant profits occur when the opening range length is within 5 minutes from the open. Their research did not consider any profit target or stop loss mechanisms. In 2017, Lundstr\u00a8 om [16] examined ORB returns in different volatility states based on long-term crude oil data and S&P 500 futures contracts, and he found that the prof- itability of ORB grows with the volatility of the underlyng asset. To improve the system and generate larger returns compared to the overall market, Wu et al. in 2020 introduced an evolutionary approach by utilizing a genetic algorithm in their ORB-based model [21]. Their method optimized thresholds and protective closing strate- gies, significantly enhancing profitability and reducing risks. This study was conducted on Taiwan Index Futures between 2007 and 2018 and showed that the introduction of a profit target is detrimental for overall profitability. The study showed enhanced prof- itability once a stop loss mechanism was introduced. 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4729284Recently, we provided significant evidence of profitability for a 5-minute ORB applied on QQQ and TQQQ ETFs [23].",

        "content": "We introduced the use of stop losses and large profit targets and found that a 5-minute ORB on TQQQ would have earned an outstanding return of 1,484% between 2016 and 2023, while a passive investment in the QQQ ETF would have earned only 169%. In this paper, our goal was to apply the 5-minute ORB framework developed in our pre- vious work [23], but instead of utilizing only QQQ or TQQQ, we expanded the study to all US stocks traded between 2016 and 2023, and assessed if trading volume and other parameters have any statistically meaningful forecasting power on day trading profitabil- ity. 2 Strategy Definition As previously referenced, a 5-minute ORB strategy is a trading strategy that focuses on catching a breakout from the initial range in the first 5 minutes of the trading day [23, 4, 5]. In this current work, we introduced a crucial parameter to this ORB strategy. If the first 5-minute candlestick was bearish (meaning it closed below its opening price), our system would only take a short position. We would not go for a long position even if the price broke above the 5-minute opening range candlestick. Similarly, if the first 5-minute candlestick was bullish (meaning it closed above the opening price), we would stick to taking only a long position. We would avoid taking a short position, even if the price dropped below the 5-minute opening range candlestick [23]. The opening range is often thought to provide some useful insight about the institutional supply and demand imbalance that will prevail throughout the day. Day traders typically employ tight stop losses to maximize exposure to intraday trends, letting profits run as long as the trend persists. Setting the right stop loss is crucial and can really make or break a trading strategy. If you set your stop loss too close to your entry point, you might get stopped out too soon or too often. This can lead to missing out on big moves, rack- 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4729284ing up small losses, and paying higher commissions and fees. On the other hand, a stop loss that is too wide could lead to bigger losses and unsatisfactory levels of reward to risk. Traders have different ways of setting stop losses. Some use technical tools like mov- ing averages, VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) or other mathematical indicators [24]. Others prefer to set them based on judgment calls, using key levels like the low or high of the day. A common approach [24, 4] is to set the stop loss at a percentage of the 14-day average true range (ATR)1. For example, as shown in Figure 2, the daily ATR of a company called BLDR on January 22, 2024 was $5. The following day the stock dipped in the first 5 minutes, prompting a sell stop order at the opening range\u2019s low ( $174.44). Half an hour later, the stock breached this level, executing the order. The stop loss was set at 10% of the daily ATR (10% x $5 = $0.50) from the entry point. We have previously looked into how using a stop loss based on ATR affects the ORB strategy and found a link between the expected value of the return and the stop loss [23]. To analyze the result, Profit & Loss (PnL) is often quantified in units of risk (R) rather than in dollar value. Figure 2 shows an example of how R unit is utilized in trade manage- ment and analysis. In this case, a short trade was triggered, and the R was the potential maximum loss per share, which was $0.50. The profit target was set at the end of the day (EoD). The trade\u2019s per share movement was $6.81 ( $174.44 - $167.63), translating to a PnL of 13.62 times the R, or 13.62R ( $6.81/0.50). The US stocks analyzed in this study encompassed all equities listed on US exchanges (both NYSE and Nasdaq) from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2023 (we called them theuniverse . This universe comprised approximately 7,000 stocks and was free from 1The ATR is a technical analysis indicator used to measure market volatility.",

The ATR calculates the average range between the highest and lowest prices over a given number of past trading sessions, typically 14 days. This range includes the comparison of the current high to the previous close, the current low to the previous close, and the current high to the current low. The ATR does not indicate price direction but rather the degree of price volatility. High ATR values indicate high volatility, suggesting wider price ranges and potentially greater risk or opportunity for traders. Conversely, low ATR values suggest low market volatility, indicating tighter price ranges. 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4729284Figure 2: A hypothetical example of the 5-minute ORB strategy discussed in this paper on Builders FirstSource, Inc.

For instance, Twitter, which was delisted on October 27, 2022, is included in our database. 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=47292842.1 Base Strategy We implemented some rules for choosing the stocks we studied. Not all stocks in the US markets are suitable for day trading due to varying levels of liquidity or trading volume. Our best approach was to exclude penny stocks and other low-liquidity stocks. To avoid making decisions based on hindsight, we used set criteria to narrow down our list of stocks on any given day. The stocks we considered had to meet the following requirements: 1. The opening price had to be above $5. 2. The average trading volume over the previous 14 days had to be at least 1,000,000 shares per day. 3. The ATR over the previous 14 days had to be more than $0.50. These criteria ensured that the stocks we analyzed had sufficient liquidity and volatility as well as favorable conditions for day trading [4, 2]. Entry Conditions With each eligible stock, we placed a stop order (not to be confused with a stop loss order) at a level equal to the high/low of the 5-minute range, in the direction of the opening range. For example, if a stock had a bullish move within the first 5 minutes of trading (from 9:30 am until 9:35 am ET), we placed a stop order at the highest value of the 5-minute opening range (known as the 5-minute high ). Conversely, if a stock had a bearish move within the first 5 minutes of trading, we placed a stop order at the lowest value of the 5-minute opening range (known as the 5-minute low ).

Stop Loss and Profit Target In case the order was triggered, we placed a stop loss order at a 10% ATR distance from the executed entry price. If the stop loss was not reached intraday, we closed the position at the end of the trading session (i.e., 4:00 pm ET). 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4729284Position Sizing Each stock was traded such that in case of the stop loss being hit, the resulting loss incurred on the capital deployed for that position would be 1%.

The backtest was conducted from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2023. We assumed a starting capital of $25,000 and incorporated a commission cost of $0.0035 per share (this figure represented the entry-level commission fee charged by Interactive Brokers Pro \u2013 Tiered as of December 31, 2023). Figure 3 displays the equity curve for the portfolio generated by the diversified 5-minute ORB strategy across all US stocks. With an initial investment of $25,000, the portfolio appreciated by 30%, resulting in a net profit of only $7,500 after accounting for commis- sion fees. In contrast, during the same period, a passive long position in the S&P 500 would have seen an increase of nearly 200%, equating to a profit of about $50,000. As detailed in Table 1, the active 5-minute ORB strategy underperformed, yielding a modest annual return of only 3.2% and experiencing an annual volatility of approxi- mately 6.6%. This resulted in a Sharpe Ratio of 0.48, which was significantly lower than the 0.78 Sharpe ratio for the S&P 500. Despite this overall underperformance when compared to the benchmark, the 5-minute ORB strategy showed some encouraging results. Specifically, its maximum drawdown (MDD) was only 13%, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s MDD of 34% within the same time frame.

Since the validity of day trading as a long-term consistent and uncorrelated source of income for traders and investors is a matter of debate, we decided to run a simple linear regression analysis to see if the 5-minute ORB returns were correlated with S&P 500 returns and to see if there was any abnormal return in excess of what can be extracted by a passive market exposure. Further insights were also gained from this simple linear regression analysis, where the daily returns of the 5-minute ORB strategy were regressed against the daily returns of the S&P 500.

        "content": "This strategy aims to identify assets that exhibit an abnormal imbalance between demand and supply in the first few minutes of the trading session. The hypothe- sis is that this imbalance will persist throughout the session, creating exploitable intraday trends. While the direction of the demand-supply imbalance can be inferred from the opening range, its abnormality can be assessed by comparing its current opening range volume to its recent average. In the following section, we introduce a straightforward metric to measure the abnormal- ity of the opening range volume. We will also examine whether this metric effectively predicts the subsequent realized PnL of the ORB strategy. 4For the purposes of simplicity, the risk-free rate was not included in the regression analysis. Nev- ertheless, throughout the backtesting period, the risk-free rate in the US was negligible and, therefore, should not have a significant impact on the results. 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=47292843 Not All Opening Range Are Created Equally You are only as good as the stocks that you trade \u2013Mike Bellafiore[6] A prevalent strategy among experienced day traders is to focus their intraday trading activities on Stocks in Play [6, 7]. A stock is considered in play when it shows unusual trading activity throughout the day, which often results in an expansion of its daily price range and a distinct trend in its intraday price movements. A stock is typically expected to be in play in response to a major fundamental catalyst that prompts institutional investors to re-evaluate their financial positions in it. Common catalysts include: \u2022Earnings reports \u2022Earnings warnings or pre-announcements \u2022Earnings surprises \u2022FDA approvals or disapprovals \u2022Mergers/acquisitions \u2022Alliances, partnerships, or major product releases \u2022Major contract wins/losses \u2022Restructuring, layoffs, or management changes \u2022Stock splits, buybacks, or debt offerings \u2022Break of key technical levels. While a fundamental catalyst is often necessary to trigger abnormal trading activity in a stock, it is not always sufficient to classify it as a Stock in Play . If the market has already priced in the catalyst, institutional investors may not react significantly, resulting in minimal trading activity. An effective method for traders to determine if a catalyst is indeed causing unusually high trading activity is through the use of Relative Volume . This metric is a statistical comparison of the day\u2019s trading volume against the average volume from previous days. For real-time analysis, traders can calculate the Relative Volume 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4729284Figure 4: Average PnL (in R) of 5-minute ORB grouped by the Relative Volume in the first 5 minutes of the trading session. continuosly throughout the day. In our study, we focused on the Relative Volume during the opening range. Specifically, we calculated the Relative Volume for each stock jafter the first 5 minutes of each trading day tusing this formula: RelativeV olume t,j=ORV olume t,j 1 14P14 i=1ORV olume t\u22121,j, where ORV olume t,jrepresents the volume traded in stock jduring the first 5-minutes of trading in day t. Building upon the basic filters used in the Base Strategy (Price >$5, Average Volume 14 Days >1,000,000 shares, ATR 14 Days >$0.50), we further analyzed the relation- ship between Relative Volume and average PnL in R. Figure 4 distinctly demonstrates a strong positive correlation between Relative Volume and subsequent realized PnL (net of commissions). As shown in Figure 4, when the Relative Volume was below 100%, the average PnL of 5-minute ORB trades was notably low at -0.02R. However, this figure improved signifi- cantly to 0.08R per trade when the Relative Volume exceeded 100%. Remarkably, at a 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4729284Relative Volume of over 30x (or more than 3,000%), the average profitability per trade soared to 0.38R. While focusing exclusively on stocks with a 30x trading activity may seem attractive in terms of PnL per trade, this approach might limit the total number of trades available per year, potentially impacting the ability to meet a predefined annual target. There is only a limited number of Stocks in Play every week that can reach such high trading volume. In the upcoming section, we will explain how we leveraged these insights to enhance the efficiency of trading the 5-minute ORB strategy in the US market.",

This means we would exclusively focus on those stocks whose Relative Volume was at least 100%. Furthermore, to ensure we were trading the most in play stocks of the day, our strategy would only take positions in the top 20 stocks experiencing the highest Relative Volume. The revised strategy incorporated the following filters: 1. The opening price had to be above $5. 2. The average trading volume over the previous 14 days had to be at least 1,000,000 shares per day. 3. The ATR over the previous 14 days had to be more than $0.50. 4. The Relative Volume had to be at least 100%. 5. Trade the stocks with the top 20 Relative Volume. As for the base strategy, the direction of each trade (long or short) was determined by the initial movement of the opening range. A positive opening range prompted a stop buy order, whereas a negative one led to a stop sell order.

If a position was not stopped during the day, it was unwound at the end of the trading day. Consistent with the Base Strategy , each stock was traded in such a way that should the stop loss be triggered, the loss on the capital allocated to that position would not exceed 1%. Additionally, we imposed a maximum leverage constraint of 4x, in line with the reg- ulations of most US FINRA-regulated brokers. The starting assets under management (AUM) and the commission per share remained the same as in the base case.

For this purpose, we investigated our ORB strategy across various time frames, limiting our study to Stocks in Play with at least 100% Relative Volume in their respective first n-minute time frame. For example, the Relative Volume for a 15-minute ORB is measured in the first 15 min- utes, and for a 30-minute ORB, it is compared with the first 30-minute average over the previous 14 days. The results are presented in Figure 6 and Table 3, comparing them to a simple S&P 500 buy-and-hold portfolio. As can be seen, the 5-minute ORB sig- nificantly outperformed the other time frames as well as a passive exposure in the S&P 500. The reason for the 5-minute ORB\u2019s superior performance is unclear and warrants further investigation. A plausible explanation might be that the shorter the time-frame that define the opening range, the greater the portion of the move captured by the ORB on trend days. 6 Best/Worst Performers on 5-minute ORB In this section, we will delve into the specifics of the 25 best and 25 worst performing stocks in the US stock market based on the results from the n-minute ORB strategies with Relative Volume above 1.",

By examining a vast dataset covering over 7,000 US stocks traded from 2016 to 2023, we have highlighted the substantial potential of the ORB strategy, especially when applied to Stocks in Play exhibiting high Relative Volume of at least 100%. Our findings underscore the strategy\u2019s effectiveness in generating consistent and uncorrelated returns, thereby addressing the long-standing debate about the feasibility of day trading 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4729284as a sustainable income source. The remarkable performance of the 5-minute ORB strategy, in particular, stands out, demonstrating a notable advantage over both longer time frames within the ORB strat- egy and a passive buy-and-hold approach. This strategy achieved a net performance of over 1,600%, with a Sharpe ratio of 2.81, and an annualized alpha of 36%, significantly outperforming the passive S&P 500 return of 198% over the same period. Such results not only provide empirical support for the ORB strategy\u2019s efficacy but also emphasize the critical role of selecting stocks with substantial trading activity, driven by underlying fundamental news, to capitalize on intraday volatility and liquidity. Furthermore, our exploration into varying time frames for the ORB strategy enriches the discourse on day trading methodologies, offering traders nuanced perspectives on optimiz- ing their strategies to enhance profitability and manage risk. The superior performance of the 5-minute ORB suggests a unique dynamic at play in the earliest phases of the trading day, highlighting an area ripe for further exploration. This paper contributes to the body of financial literature by providing a detailed, stock- specific analysis of ORB performance across different time frames, a first of its kind with such intraday granularity.",

Evidence of Sustainable Long-term Profits from Opening Range Breakout (ORB) Day Trading Strategy vs. Benchmark in the US Stock Market Carlo Zarattini1, Andrew Aziz2,3 1Concretum Research, Piazza Molino Nuovo 8, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland 2Peak Capital Trading, 744 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6C 1A5 3Bear Bull Traders, 744 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6C 1A5 /enve\u2640e1c.zarattini@concretumresearch.com,2andrew@peakcapitaltrading.com X1@ConcretumR,2@BearBullTraders February 20, 2024 Abstract The validity of day trading as a long-term consistent and uncorrelated source of income for traders and investors is a matter of debate. In this paper, we investi- gate the profitability of the well-known Opening Range Breakout (ORB) strategy during the period of 2016 to 2023. This period encompasses two bear markets and a few events with abnormal volatility. Our results suggest that with the proper use of leverage or leveraged products (such as 3x leveraged ETFs), day trading can empirically produce significant returns when compared to a standard buy and hold strategy on benchmark indexes in the US public equity markets (Nasdaq or NYSE). Without any loss of generality, we studied the results of an ORB strategy implemented in QQQ. By comparing the results of the active day trading approach with a passive exposure in QQQ, we prove that it is possible for the ORB portfolio to significantly outperform the passive investment. In fact, the day trading portfo- lio produced an annualized alpha of 33% (net of commissions). Nevertheless, due to leverage constraints enforced by brokers, an active trader would have capped the full upside potential given by the ORB strategy. To overcome this issue, we introduced the use of TQQQ, a leveraged ETF of QQQ, which allows day traders to fully exploit the benefit of the active strategy while adhering to leverage constraints. The resulting portfolio would have earned an outstanding return of 1,484% during the same period of 2016 to 2023, while an investment in the QQQ ETF would have earned only 169%.

With the advent of new trading technologies and increased access to financial markets, more and more individuals are turning to day trad- ing as a way to potentially generate significant returns. In fact, the rise of retail day traders has been so pronounced that it has been described as a \u201cboom\u201d in the industry. However, it was not until the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020 that retail day trading experienced a truly explosive growth [1, 2]. With lockdowns and work from home policies in place, people found themselves with more time on their hands and many turned to day trading as a way to supplement their income or simply to pass the time. The impact of this surge in retail day trading was felt throughout the financial markets, with notable examples of retail traders making major gains in the stock market, the cryptocurrency market, and other major financial markets [2]. For instance, in August 2020, shares of Tesla soared over 70% in just two weeks, driven in part by retail traders piling into the stock. Similarly, in January 2021, a group of retail traders on Reddit managed to squeeze short sellers out of their positions in GameStop, causing the stock to skyrocket by over 1,600% [3]. Despite the growing popularity of day trading and the potential profitability of certain strategies, there are still many who doubt its validity as a long-term consistent approach to trading. This skepticism stems from a number of concerns, including the perceived difficulty of consistently generating profits through short-term trades, the potential for high transaction costs and taxes, and the risks associated with leveraging and margin trading [4]. For example, Chague et al., in a study published in 2020, showed that it was virtually impossible for individuals to day trade the Brazilian equity futures market (ranked third in the world in terms of volume) between 2013 and 2015. They reported that 97% of all traders who traded more than 300 days in that period lost money [5]. As another example, Barber et al.",

They concluded that less than 1% 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4416622of those day traders were able to predictably and reliably earn positive abnormal returns net of fees [6]. Additionally, some critics argue that day trading is essentially a form of gambling and that its success is largely based on luck rather than skill. They contend that day traders are simply trying to beat the market in the short term, rather than focusing on building long-term wealth through sound investment principles [7, 8]. On the other hand, supporters of day trading argue that, when done correctly, it can be a valid and profitable approach to trading. They note that successful day traders employ rigorous risk management strategies, rely on proven trading methodologies, and stay disciplined and focused in the face of market volatility [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Ultimately, the validity of day trading as a long-term consistent approach to trading is a matter of debate. While there are certainly risks involved and success is never guaranteed, many traders continue to find success through careful planning, disciplined execution, and a commitment to ongoing learning and improvement. One popular strategy employed by day traders is the n-minute ORB strategy [9]. As shown in Figure 1, this approach usually involves identifying the high and low points of a stock during the first n-minutes of trading, and then buying or selling when the stock breaks out of this range. A more simplistic version of this strategy can be obtained by buying or selling at the open of the second candle in the same direction of the first n-minute candle. This strategy is often used because it can generate quick profits, with traders looking to capitalize on the volatility that can occur at the beginning of the trad- ing day. Aziz et al. have released several publications on using the ORB strategy in the US stock market [9, 11, 12]. The objective of this paper is to examine the performance of the 5-minute ORB and to determine if it can beat a passive exposure on a well-known market index. Moreover, this paper clearly identifies the benefits for day traders obtained by the introduction of leveraged ETFs. Our analysis was conducted during the period of January 1, 2016 to February 17, 2023. 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4416622Figure 1: Conceptual illustrations of where a trader would enter into a trade and set the stop loss when using the ORB strategy for going long (as shown on the left-hand side) and for going short (as shown on the right-hand side). By increasing the sample period, the significance of our results would have been higher; nevertheless, due to changes in market dynamics and liquidity, we preferred to focus our empirical investigation on the most recent years. Overall, this paper aims to contribute to the growing body of research on day trading strategies as well as provide valuable insights for both retail and institutional traders seeking to improve their performance in the market. 2 Strategy Definition As previously referenced, a 5-minute ORB strategy is a strategy that allows the trader to bet on a breakout from the opening range during the first 5 minutes of the trading session. We applied the ORB strategy on the QQQ ETF1, which is the most liquid in- strument available that replicates the Nasdaq Index. This strategy can take both a long and a short exposure. Our model assumed that if there was to be an ORB, it would occur in the same direction of the first 5-minute move. In other words, if during the first 5 minutes the market moved up, we took a bullish position starting from the second candle\u2019s opening price. Conversely, if the first 5-minute candle was negative, we took a bearish position at the open of the second 5-minute candle. No positions were opened 1The Invesco QQQ ETF holds a group of cutting-edge Nasdaq-100 companies known as the \u201ctech sec- tor\u201d.

The stop loss was placed at the low of the day (which was the low of the first 5-minute candle) for a long trade, and at the high of the day (which was the high of the first 5-minute candle) for a short trade, as shown conceptually in Figure 1. The distance between the entry price and the stop is labeled as Risk ($R). We set the profit target at 10x the $R. Should the target not have been reached by the end of the day (EoD), we liquidated the position at market closure. We assumed a starting capital of $25,000, a maximum leverage of 4x, and a commission of $0.0005/share traded. The trading size was calibrated such that if a stop was hit, we lost 1% of our capital. We used a 1% risk budget per trade as the historical average daily move on QQQ is 1%. The summary of our model input variables is shown in Table 2. It is important to note that we deliberately kept the model very simple and did not try to \u201coptimize\u201d the pa- rameters for better performance. The goal of this paper is to empirically compare the performance of a simple ORB strategy with a simple buy and hold market benchmark, and not to introduce a highly optimized, high-performance trading algorithm. The appropriate share size was calculated by factoring in the size of the trading account, the amount of $R, the percentage of the capital we wanted to risk per trade (1%), and the maximum leverage allowed by the broker (explained in more detail by Elder [15] and Aziz [9, 12]). Accordingly, the formula utilized was: Shares = int\u0014 min\u0012A\u00d70.01 $R,4\u00d7A P\u0013\u0015 , where Shares represents the number of shares to be bought or sold, Pis the opening price of the second 5-minute candle, Adenotes the size of the trading account, and $Ris the risk being assumed, calculated as $R = P - StopPrice. The function intis used to en- sure that the share count is a whole number, as trading fractions of a share is not possible. For comparison purposes, we created a benchmark that tracked the value of a portfolio that held a passive long exposure on QQQ with a starting capital of $25,000.

The economic outperformance is significant: a $25,000 day trading account on January 1, 2016 would be worth $192,806 (net of commissions) as of February 17, 2023. That is an outstanding total return of 675%. On the other hand, the benchmark would be worth $67,307, which corresponds to a total return of 169%. To gauge the outperformance of the active strategy in excess of market risk (or benchmark risk), we ran the following regression2on daily returns: 2The\u03b1can be interpreted as the return of the strategy in excess of the market risk.

The beta coefficient was not statistically different from zero, which implies that our active approach was not correlated with the benchmark. The unsignificant level of beta suggests that over the backtested period, the active strat- egy switched equally from long to short, reducing the level of correlation with respect to a passive long only exposure on QQQ. In fact, out of 1,795 trades, 51% were long trades while 49% were short.

All conditions were set as Table 2. of return was 31%. As exhibited in Figure 3, we further analyzed the results of the strategy by plotting the time-series of the daily PnL (normalized by the $R). As expected, due to the stop loss in place, the maximum daily loss was capped at -1R (a bit larger due to commissions). On the other hand, profits were capped at 10R. Profits were often below 10R, which means that the position was liquidated at market closure and the 10R profit was not reached. The Win Rate of the strategy was 24%, which made the average PnL per trade equal to 0.13R. A low accuracy was compensated by the asymmetry between gains and losses. A further analysis of the historical PnL of the strategy suggested that many trades were not traded in full-size and the overall PnL therefore ended up being just a fraction of the R3. The reason for this \u201canomaly\u201d is found in the leverage limit imposed by the broker. As referenced in the strategy description, most US brokers do not allow intraday traders to take positions more than 4x greater than the net liquidation value of their portfolio.

In conclusion, the first implementation of the ORB strategy in QQQ, even if attractive from a return-to-risk perspective, does not fully exploit its edge over time. To address this issue, we introduced the use of ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ4), a leveraged and liquid ETF that gives traders a 3x exposure to the daily fluctuation of QQQ. We surmised that the introduction of TQQQ would allow traders to circumvent the issue related to leverage constraints. In fact, a $100 exposure in TQQQ should be approximately equal, on a daily basis, to a $300 exposure on QQQ. Assuming a maximum leverage of 4x, it means that a $25,000 account may be exposed to the same $daily moves obtained by a $300,000 account fully invested in QQQ. We ran the 5-minute ORB strategy on TQQQ and plotted the results in Figure 5. The portfolio tracked very closely the value arising from the implementation of the uncon- strained version of the ORB strategy on QQQ. The use of TQQQ improved significantly the results of the ORB strategy and an astonishing total return of 1,484% was achieved during the 7-year period. The outperformance versus the passive benchmark is evident and confirmed by the results of the following regression: Ret ORB TQQQ =\u03b1+\u03b2\u00d7Ret QQQ. The annualized alpha was 48% (net of commissions) (p.value = 0.0013) while the beta 4TQQQ is one of the largest ETFs with assets under management of $13.13 billion (as of 21 March 2023). Due in part to QQQ\u2019s popularity, issuers of leveraged ETFs have tapped traders\u2019 thirst for more exotic ways to play the Nasdaq-100. TQQQ\u2019s objective is simple: to deliver triple the daily returns of the Nasdaq-100. Therefore, if that index rises by 1% on a particular day, TQQQ should jump by 3%. As is the case with any leveraged ETF, TQQQ is an instrument best used over intraday time frames, not as a buy and hold investment. Investors and traders who do not consider themselves \u201cactive\u201d and \u201crisk-tolerant\u201d should eschew leveraged ETFs. In a paper published in 2021, Lewis investigated the long- term investing in 3x leveraged ETFs and concluded that as a result of daily rebalancing and so-called \u201cbeta slippage\u201d or \u201cthe constant leverage trap\u201d, it is highly likely that over the long term, the result of leveraged ETFs will significantly deviate from the targeted leverage and, in so doing, generate wipeout losses. In fact, his data show that many 3x leveraged ETFs have performed poorly over the long term in the period of their existence. 10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4416622Figure 5: A comparison between the equity curve performance of the ORB portfolio that day traded the QQQ ETF (both long and short) without any leverage constraints, the equity curve performance of the ORB portfolio that day traded the TQQQ ETF (both long and short), and the equity curve performance of the portfolio that passively utilized a simple buy and hold strategy in QQQ and TQQQ.

The Sharpe Ratio was 1.19 and the annualized rate of return was 46%. During the same period, the passive benchmark (QQQ) would have earned an annualized return of 15% (169% total return). As exhibited in Figure 6, by plotting the time-series of the daily PnL (in unit of Risk), we noticed that the average gain increased significantly (versus the ORB strategy in QQQ) and the resulting average PnL per trade was 0.18R (versus 0.13R for the ORB strategy in QQQ). There were only 10% of days when the exposure was capped by the leverage constraints, and in those few cases, the reduction of the exposure was approximately 30%.

For example, in 2018, we experienced a short volatility shock coined \u201cVolmageddon\u201d, which resulted in the collapse of many large short volatility players [16]. Moreover, in March 2020, we experienced a short-lived but scary bear market due to COVID-19 and the effects of global lockdowns. The subsequent re- covery was spectacular and unprecedented, triggering a 2-year strong bull market led by the tech sector. As well, in 2022, we experienced a gradual and less volatile bear market caused by the aggressive interest rate hikes of the Federal Reserve. As can be seen in Figure 5, the ORB strategy worked well and was consistently profitable in both bull and bear markets. Without a doubt, the active approach proposed by this paper will allow a disciplined day trader to profitably navigate different market regimes that can vary in terms of overall direction and volatility. Further, the outperformance of the active approach is easily grasped during bear markets, when the passive benchmark suffered from the decline of equity markets. 4 A Further Investigation As previously mentioned, for the active approach described in the previous pages of this paper, we did not try to optimize the parameters for better performance. As a conse- 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4416622Table 2: Performance statistics.

We decided to thus investigate the sensitivity of the overall results to changes in the stop loss and profit target. The results were fascinating. Instead of using the low or the high of the day for stop loss placement, we decided to use a fraction of the 14-day average true range (ATR) for the stop loss. We surmised that a fixed percentage of the ATR should be a better and more stable representation of the volatility of the stock during the day. For the profit target, we ran an analysis of profit targets that ranged from 1R to 10R and EoD. We noticed that the best results were achieved, as shown in Figure 7, with tight stop losses (5% of the 14-day ATR) and by keeping the trade active until EoD in order to maximize the possible R as the profit target. This is a truly fascinating result, as it empirically confirms the correctness of the commonly used saying to cut losses quickly (by having a small stop loss) and to let profits run (by having a large profit target or by reaching EoD). The results are shown graphically in Figure 8. As can be seen in Figure 8, an ORB strategy on TQQQ implemented with a stop that was equal to 5% of the 14-day ATR and without any profit target (the position was liquidated at market closure), would have increased by 9,350% between January 1, 2016 and February 17, 2023, and would have produced an annualized alpha of 93% (net of commissions). A $25,000 trading account would therefore have grown to $6,400,000 (net of commissions). However, it is important to note that this result can under certain circumstances be considered unrealistic as our model assumed no slippage. Given their high volume and liquidity, when trading QQQ and TQQQ in small share sizes, a trader can safely assume there will be small to no slippage. When trading with a large account 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4416622Figure 7: 3-D heatmap showing the average PnL (in R) with respect to stop losses and profit targets for the ORB portfolio that day traded the TQQQ ETF (both long and short).",

With a large account and a large share exposure, the stop will likely be exceeded. 5 Conclusion Based on the analysis we ran from 2016 to 2023, we can conclude that day trading QQQ with an ORB approach can be a highly profitable strategy returning approximately 675% in 7 years (net of commissions).

Gray highlighting has been used to show when there were bear markets. Other conditions were set as Table 2 long only exposure in QQQ during both bull and bear markets. Our research has also demonstrated the power of using leveraged ETFs such as TQQQ to circumvent the leverage constraints imposed by the brokers that do not allow a trader to fully exploit the edge given by their day trading strategy. In fact, by only trading QQQ, the ORB exposure will be suboptimal 60% of the time, creating a major diver- gence between the realized returns and those achievable by an account with no leverage constraints. By introducing the use of TQQQ, the returns of ORB improved significantly, filling the gap between the previously implemented version and the unconstrained lever- age strategy. The use of leveraged ETFs can thus increase the value of a trader\u2019s US stock market day trading account. 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4416622However, it is important to note that the use of leverage also increases the level of risk involved in day trading and execution errors may have significant impacts on the value of a trader\u2019s day trading account. The main source of risk, at least in our framework, is not coming from losses due to strategy failure (in fact, we always traded with a stop loss regardless of whether we traded QQQ or TQQQ), but from operational risks such as slippage (i.e., stops not properly executed), not respecting basic day trading rules (e.g., turning a day trade into a swing trade or a buy and hold position), exiting too early from a position before reaching the final target, and so on. In conclusion, our study provides empirical evidence that day trading can produce excel- lent and uncorrelated returns. The proposed ORB strategy can significantly enhance the profitability of a trading account, but it requires a high level of effort and attention to market fluctuation. Contrary to what is commonly believed by those who are skeptical about the usefulness of using day trading strategies, we believe that there may be great value in combining lower-frequency investments (such as long-term buy and hold equity indexes) with higher-frequency approaches. Further, those willing to also diversify in terms of trading frequencies should expect to generate better risk-adjusted returns. 16 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4416622Author Biography Andrew Aziz Andrew Aziz is a Canadian trader, in- vestor, and official Forbes Council member.

Introduction A growing body of literature in finance documents the remarkable ability of machine learning techniques to enhance predictability in the cross-section of stock returns.1Studies that use these techniques to extract expected return signals routinely report annualized Sharpe ratios on trading strategies employing these signals in excess of 1.0, with extreme examples exceeding 2.0 (e.g., Freyberger et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023; Cong et al., 2020), performance that corresponds to about five times the historical market Sharpe ratio of 0.43, estimated over the entire CRSP sample from 1925-2021. Despite this impressive paper performance, the extent to which these strategies can be implemented in practice remains an ongoing debate. Avramov et al. (2022) argue that trading strategies based on machine learning models extract profitability from difficult-to-arbitrage stocks and during high limits-to-arbitrage market states, and their performance deteriorates in the presence of economic constraints because of high turnover. Li et al. (2022) construct real-time machine learning strategies based on a \"universe\" of fundamental signals and find significantly weaker performance. Blitz et al. (2023) advocate using longer prediction horizons to train the machine learning models and show that those can improve performance even after accounting for 25-basis-points-per-trade transaction costs. Jensen et al. (2022) go further and develop a framework that integrates trading-cost-aware portfolio optimization with machine learning. Complicating the matters, simply accounting for transaction costs still does not answer the question of what the expected returns on machine learning strategies are and whether we can expect to see similar performance in the future. This question is more subtle, because many anomalies were not discovered for significant periods of the samples in which they are typically used for backtesting machine learning strategies. Thus, even if we make the optimistic assumption that the machine learning techniques were available for investors, the anomaly signals were not. Moreover, individual anomaly performance deteriorates post-publication (Mclean and Pontiff, 2016) and has further deteriorated in the more recent sample post-decimalization due to the new era of investment and trading technology (Chordia et al., 2014). Chen and Velikov (2023) show that the profitability of the average anomaly virtually disappears after accounting for three distinct effects: 1) transaction costs, 2) post-publication 1See, e.g., Gu et al. (2020); Leippold et al. (2022); Hanauer and Kalsbach (2023); Azevedo and Hoegner (2023); Chen et al. (2023); Azevedo et al. (2023); Cakici et al. (2023). 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4702406decay, and 3) the effect of decimalization on liquidity. In their data, the strongest anomalies net expected returns of around 10 basis points per month, and even simple strategies that combine the entire anomaly zoo yield around 20 basis points per month in expectation. Whether their conclusions extend to more sophisticated machine learning techniques, however, is an empirical question. In this study, we aim to fill this gap in the literature and estimate the expected returns on machine-learning anomaly strategies accounting for the three effects noted above.",

        "content": "To this end, we estimate return signals by combining up to 320 published anomalies from the Chen and Zimmermann (2022) dataset using nine different machine learning techniques: Ordinary Least Square with Huber Loss Function (OLS-HUBER), an Elastic Net (ENET), which combines a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and ridge regression, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with two to five hidden layers (FFNN2, FFNN3, FFNN4, and FFNN5), two variations on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with one and two hidden layers (LSTM1 and LSTM2), and an ensemble model. We construct trading strategies based on these signals and study their post-2005 performance net of the high-frequency effective bid-ask spread estimates from Chen and Velikov (2023). We find that machine learning combination signals perform well based on common out-of- sample regression metrics, even during the more recent era of high liquidity, and only including anomalies after their publication dates. For example, the out-of-sample R2\u2019s vary from 0.05% for OLS-HUBER to 0.76% for LSTM1. The feedforward neural network-based models rank in between, with R2\u2019s ranging from 0.19% to 0.36%. Similarly, decile-sorted, value-weighted trading strategies based on the machine learning combination signals earn significant returns of up to 1.63% per month and Fama and French (2018) six-factor model alphas of up to 1.40% per month before costs in the post-2005 period. The average returns are also accompanied by economically large Sharpe ratios, ranging from 0.32 (OLS-HUBER) to 1.11 (LSTM1). Due to the improved liquidity in the post-2005 period, the trading costs associated with these strategies are on the order of 20-25 basis points per month. As a result, contrary to the insights of Avramov et al. (2022), most machine learning combination strategies continue to deliver significant returns net of costs despite one-sided turnover ranging between 60% and 70%. While the Chen and Velikov (2023) effective spread estimator renders the average returns to a few of the strategies insignificant (OLS-HUBER, FFNN2, FFN5), the rest of the signals continue to generate sizable and statistically significant average returns ranging from 0.64% per 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4702406month (t-statistic of 2.43) for ENET to 1.42% per month (t-statistic of 3.99) for LSTM1. The machine learning signals continue to generate significant net performance even after accounting for their exposure to the Fama and French (2018) six-factor model factors, gauged using Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) generalized alphas, which measure the extent to which a test asset improves the ex-post mean-variance efficient portfolio, accounting for the costs of trading both the asset and the explanatory factors. The generalized alphas of all machine learning strategies are positive, with five out of nine being also statistically significantly different from zero. This indicates that an investor with access to the net returns of the six Fama and French (2018) factors would have benefited from investing in the net machine learning strategies. However, the construction of the machine learning strategies discussed so far largely ignores trading costs. Avramov et al. (2022) apply economic constraints, such as excluding the bottom 20% of stocks by market capitalization or filtering out the 30% stocks with the highest previous transaction costs. Similarly, Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) and Novy-Marx and Velikov (2019) explore transaction cost mitigation techniques such as increasing the holding period to up to four months or introducing trading hysteresis through a Buy-Hold-Spread (BHS) (i.e., entering a position for a top/bottom decile but exiting it only if they fall out of the top-/bottom-quintile). Applying these mitigation techniques results in a significant reduction in turnover and transaction costs. However, the corresponding reduction in gross average returns makes up for it in most cases. Increasing the holding period to two months is the only technique leading to average net performance improvements across all machine learning strategies. However, even in that case, that improvement is marginal at only five basis points. Our paper contributes to a fast growing literature on using machine learning in asset pricing settings. Many papers demonstrate the impressive predictive power of machine learning signals in the cross-section of U.S. stock returns. For example, Freyberger et al. (2020) use adaptive group LASSO, Gu et al. (2020) survey and apply many machine learning techniques including elastic net, dimension reduction techniques (PCR and PLS), trees, and neural networks.",

The Chen and Velikov (2023) effective bid-ask spread measure we employ presents a more realistic estimate of trading costs post-decimalization since it is based on high-frequency TAQ data. To the best of our knowledge, we are also the first to estimate the Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) generalized alphas for machine learning strategies. Integrating these generalized alphas into machine learning approaches enables a more precise comparison and understanding of risk-adjusted net returns. This method directly addresses the frequently overlooked impact of trading costs in asset pricing models, a factor often neglected in studies that use gross return asset pricing models to explain anomalies in net returns. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that machine learning strategies can be profitable, even in the recent era of high liquidity and when using only discovered anomalies. This is in stark contrast to the conclusions in Avramov et al. (2022). While it is true that machine learning strategies concentrate on historically difficult-to-arbitrage stocks, value-weighting stocks in the portfolios and the sharp decline in trading costs over the past couple of decades combine to result in significant profits for these strategies. Our study is also related to recent papers that use machine learning techniques to construct improved factor models (Feng et al., 2023), show that technical analysis works, though its profitability decreases through time (Brogaard and Zareei, 2023), explain the post-earnings announcementdrift(HansenandSiggaard,2023;Meursaultetal.,2023), measurefirmcomplexity (Loughran and McDonald, 2023), and uncover sparsity and heterogeneity in firm-level return predictability (Evgeniou et al., 2023). Finally, we also add to the debate on the virtue of complexity. Kelly et al. (2023) establish the rationale for using machine learning to model expected returns and theoretically show that \"complex\" models should outperform \"simple\" models. Consistent with their findings, our strongest results are obtained using the most sophisticated machine learning models - the LSTM. All of our machine learning strategies are stronger compared to the ones in Chen and Velikov (2023), who find that using simpler combination techniques results in measly expected returns for strategies based on sorts of individual stock returns. 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=47024062. Methodology and Data This section describes our data and methodology. 2.1. Data Sources, Samples and Pre-Processing Our anomaly data come from Chen and Zimmermann (2022), who provide the most com- prehensive dataset of replicated anomalies.2We use the March 2022 version of their signals. Motivated by Kelly et al. (2023), we download all 320 anomalies to ensure we provide our machine learning signals with the largest set of characteristics possible. We follow common practice and include only common equity stocks (CRSP share code 10 or 11). Our sample is from March 1957 to December 2021, totaling ~3.4mn stock-month observations over nearly 65 years. The anomaly signals have varying ranges of values over which they are defined, making it more difficult for neural networks to estimate suitable parameters during training (Singh and Singh, 2020). Consequently, we follow the current literature by percent-ranking all anomaly features into the same range [-1;1] (Kelly et al., 2019; Freyberger et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2020). Missing values are replaced with 0. We enrich the anomaly dataset with further relevant data points following Gu et al.",

The objective is to inform our models about the current macroeconomic situation and make them capable of setting it into context for anomaly returns. Furthermore, we incorporate the 49 Fama and French (1997) industry classification indicators publicly available on the Kenneth R. French data library3into the feature set. We use one-hot encoding to ensure that our studied models do not suffer multi-collinearity issues, leading to 48 additional features. Next-month returns, market capitalization, and further metadata are obtained from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). This leads to 320 + 8 + 48 = 376 features per observation for our models. Figure 1 reports the number of input features we use over time. For the first year of our asset pricing tests, 2005, our models only use the 137 anomalies from Chen and Zimmermann (2022) with publication dates up to 2004, resulting in 137 + 48 + 8 = 193 features. The Chen 2For a detailed description of the methodology and anomaly composition, as well as the corresponding code and dataset, see their website: https://www.openassetpricing.com 3For more information, see https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4702406and Zimmermann (2022) database ends in 2016, at which point our list of features reaches its maximum of 376. [Figure 1 about here.] To train our machine learning models and tune hyperparameters without any data snooping or look-ahead bias, we follow standard machine learning practice and split the overall dataset into three subsets: a training-, validation-, and testing-set. To allow our model to learn from new information and adapt to the non-stationarity characteristics of stock return time series, we follow the latest literature using an expanding window approach for the training data (Gu et al., 2020; Azevedo and Hoegner, 2023). We re-train the models annually to include new data while keeping a fixed-length moving validation set of six years and a one-year out-of-sample test set. For example, for the out-of-sample year 2005, we use all available stock-month observations from Mar 1957 to Dec 1998 to train the model. We then tune hyperparameters based on the six-year validation set from Jan 1999 to Dec 2004 to ensure the temporal ordering of the observations in the training process. The out-of-sample test set, which we use to evaluate our models regarding machine learning metrics and long-short portfolio performance, contains predictions for January 2005 to December 2021 (i.e., each new year, we move this approach one year ahead, extending the training set). The portfolio construction process follows common practices in anomaly research. We construct decile portfolios based on the models\u2019 next-month stock return predictions, calculating the long-short gross excess return on a monthly rebalancing frequency. Transaction costs are estimated using the composite high-frequency Chen and Velikov (2023) effective bid-ask spread estimator and applied in the calculation of the net excess return following Detzel et al. (2023). To ensure an openly accessible and thus replicable construction and testing protocol, we use the methodology and library of Novy-Marx and Velikov (2023). Further construction details can be found in their paper and on their website.4 2.2. Applied machine learning algorithms and evaluation methodology Our choice of machine learning models is motivated by prior literature, which shows that neural networks outperform traditional linear regressions as well as penalized ones such as elastic nets (Gu et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023; Azevedo and Hoegner, 2023; Azevedo et al., 4Documentation available at http://assayinganomalies.com/ . 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=47024062023; Avramov et al., 2022). We follow Gu et al. (2020), and include the non-constrained OLS-HUBER, a regularized linear model using ENET, and four feedforward neural networks (FFNNs) with hidden layers ranging from two to five.5We extend this core model set with two (one- and two-hidden layers, respectively) recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTMs), which are designed to capture long-term dependencies. Finally, we create an (ENSEMBLE) model by taking the average of all deep-learning models (FFNNs and LSTMs). Following Chen et al. (2023), we use hyperparameter tuning to find the best set of parameters in each model.",

        "content": "To optimize the tuning parameters for each model, we initially implemented a random search strategy. For efficiency and computational practicality, we selected a represen- tative subset of the data, comprising 20% of the total dataset, to fine-tune these parameters. Once established, these parameters were consistently applied throughout the expanding window estimation process. However, this approach was not feasible for neural network models due to their extensive computational demands and the wide variability in their parameter ranges. For the neural network approaches, we apply a fixed set of parameters. Like Gu et al. (2020), we use the geometric rule to derive the specific neuron configuration for our 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-hidden-layer FFNNs, and similarly for our 1- and 2-hidden layer LSTMs. All neural networks use an ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, the mean squared error (MSE) validation metric, and 200 epochs with a batch size of 10,000 observations. We apply dynamic learning rate shrinkage by factor 5 when our validation metrics have not improved for ten epochs of training. We also regularize the models through an early stopping callback, which stops training when validation metrics have not improved for 20 epochs. We evaluate the actual out-of-sample trading strategy performance using common portfolio metrics, mainly gross and net excess return of the long-short portfolios, their statistical signifi- cance, Sharpe ratio, information ratio, turnover ratio, and transaction costs, as well as the R2. Also, we test the model against the most comprehensive factor model to date, the Fama and French (2018) six-factor model (FF6). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to estimate the Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) generalized alphas to machine-learning-based strategies in order to evaluate the ability of these strategies to expand the net-of-costs mean-variance efficient frontier based on the six factors alone. 5A more detailed explanation of the models can be found in the internet appendix of Gu et al. (2020). 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=47024062.3. Applied turnover and cost mitigation techniques Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) and Novy-Marx and Velikov (2019) study the impact of cost-mitigation techniques on the profitability of anomaly trading strategies after accounting for trading costs. In addition to their proposed three techniques, we add further variations and filters to test the effect of cost mitigation on the net performance of machine-learning-based strategies. One major driver to reduce transaction costs is to reduce turnover rate. Most straightfor- wardly, this can be achieved using an increased holding period/reduced rebalancing frequency for the portfolio construction. Since we train our models based on monthly predictions, we extend the holding period mitigation to 2-, 3-, or 4-months (H2, H3, H4). Additionally, we create quintile- instead of decile portfolios (QUINTILE), hypothesizing that this could reduce turnover while keeping a significant signal-to-noise ratio. As a more complex variation of adapted overall holding period and number of portfolios, we apply the BHS technique outlined by Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) to enter a position for the top-/bottom-decile but exit a position only if they fall out of the top-/bottom-quintile. Furthermore, we test multiple stock universe filters and weightings. We follow Fama- French in creating a high-market cap filter that excludes the bottom 20% of stocks by market capitalization for our tradable stock universe (HMCAP20). We hypothesize that those high market capitalization stocks are more liquid, i.e., they should face lower transaction costs. In addition, we follow the approach of Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) in directly filtering out stocks with high previous transaction costs, i.e., using only stocks in the bottom 70%-percentile transaction costs (LTC 70). As an alternative way to incorporate transaction costs into the portfolio construction process, we weight predictions to 25% with the transaction cost percentile (TCWEIGHTED75).6Finally, we create two combination strategies that use (a) both H2 and BHS (COMBO1) and (b) H2, BHS, and TCWEIGHTED75 (COMBO2). 3.

The average monthly excess returns to these strategies range from an insignificant 48 basis points per month (t-statistic 1.34) for OLS-HUBER to an impressive 1.63% per month (t-statistic of 4.57) for LSTM1. Five of the nine strategies\u2019 average returns have t-statistics above 3, the threshold suggested by Harvey et al. (2016). The out-of-sample R2\u2019s vary from 0.05% for OLS-HUBER to 0.76% for LSTM1. The feedforward neural network-based models rank in between, with R2\u2019s ranging from 0.19% to 0.36%. The Fama and French (2018) six-factor model alphas exhibit similar patterns, with the LSTM1 model-based trading strategy having the highest alpha of 1.40% per month. The Sharpe ratios for these strategies are impressive even when benchmarked against the post-2005 Sharpe ratio of 0.69, where five out of nine machine learning strategies come out on top. Moreover, given that these are hedge strategies that are, for the most market neutral, their information ratios, even to the Fama and French (2018) six-factor model, are sizable, ranging from 0.52-1.01. [Table 1 about here.] 4. Machine learning performance accounting for transaction costs Thus far, we estimate the long-short returns of machine learning models without accounting for transaction costs. Avramov et al. (2022) argue that when transaction costs are introduced, most models do not show statistically significant returns because their performance largely depends on small, illiquid, and expensive stocks. We test this explicitly and observe a reduction in average monthly returns and overall financial performance after accounting for the Chen and Velikov (2023) effective bid-ask spread estimate. Figure 2 shows the percentage drop in average returns for the nine machine-learning strategies from introducing trading costs. We can observe that the reduction in performance ranges from 13% to 40%. [Figure 2 about here.] Table 2 reports the performance metrics for our nine machine-learning-based strategies after accounting for trading costs. We can observe that costs have a significant impact on performance, reducing average returns across the board. The trading costs for the strategies, reported in the last column, range between 19 and 26 basis points per month, rendering the average returns to FFNN2 and FFNN5 insignificant. The two-sided portfolio turnover, reported in the second-to- last column, varies between 120 and 140% per month, classifying the machine-learning strategies as high-turnover anomalies based on the Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) taxonomy. 10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4702406Nevertheless, we still observe economically and statistically significant average returns and generalized six-factor model alphas for the majority of the models. Both LSTM strategies continue to exhibit t-statistics on their average returns and alphas in excess of three. The feedforward neural network models perform slightly worse, but their average returns and alphas are still sizable. The clear winner is the LSTM1 strategy, which earns an impressive 1.42% per month (t-stat of 3.99) and a generalized FF 6 alpha of 1.20% ( t-stat of 3.46). [Table 2 about here.] Figure 3 shows the cumulative netperformance of the machine learning strategies. It reveals that the outperformance of the LSTM and ENSEMBLE strategies is largely due to their impressive performance during the Great Recession. All other machine learning strategies exhibitedaseveredrawdownin2009, whichtheLSTMstrategiescompletelyandtheENSEMBLE strategy to some extent are able to avoid. The LSTM1 strategy also performed better in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2020, while all other strategies suffered losses. [Figure 3 about here.] 5. Applying turnover and transaction cost mitigation strategies The machine-learning-based strategies examined thus far were designed without regard for trading costs. Recently, Blitz et al. (2023) show that training the models in a longer time horizon can lead to higher returns. Furthermore, Avramov et al. (2022) show that excluding firms with economic constraints can reduce the significance of machine learning models.",

        "content": "In this section, we investigate different mitigation techniques and their impact on the net performance of machine learning-based strategies. [Figure 4 about here.] Table 3 and Figure 4 show the impact of the previously outlined mitigation approaches on our four classes of model architectures, namely linear models, FFNNs, LSTMs, and the ensemble model. We show the impact of absolute differences in the net excess return portfolio metrics and generalized FF6 alpha and relative changes in turnover and transaction costs. As the results show, most of the cost-mitigation techniques significantly reduce turnover and, as a result, transaction costs. 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4702406[Table 3 about here.] This decrease in transaction costs, however, is only beneficial if it is not accompanied by a larger reduction in gross returns. As we can observe in Table 3, the average change net excess returns across the nine machine learning models is negative for all but one mitigation technique. This implies that the drop in the gross average returns due to the mitigation techniques more than compensates for the reduced trading costs. This is likely because our testing sample period, which consists of the last two decades, is marked by higher liquidity and significantly lower trading costs post-decimalization (Chordia et al., 2014; Chen and Velikov, 2023). The only technique that seems to marginally improve the net average returns across the nine machine learning strategies is the two-month holding period. Not surprisingly, the stock universe filters have a smaller impact on turnover but a similar impact on transaction costs, as they aim to reduce the weight of high-cost stocks. However, the change in net excess returns for these methods is similarly negative. 6. Conclusion Our study assesses the expected returns of machine learning-based trading strategies. We do so by accounting for transaction costs, post-publication decay, and the recent era of high liquidity. Due to the improved liquidity in this more recent period, the trading costs associated with these strategies are on the order of 20-25 basis points per month. As a result, contrary to the insights of Avramov et al. (2022), most machine learning combination strategies continue to deliver significant returns net of costs despite one-sided turnover ranging between 60% and 70%. While the Chen and Velikov (2023) effective spread estimator renders the average returns to a few of the strategies insignificant (OLS-HUBER, FFNN2, FFN5), the rest of the signals continue to generate sizable and statistically significant average returns ranging from 0.64% per month (t-statistic of 2.43) for ENET to 1.42% per month (t-statistic of 3.99) for LSTM1. We also find that cost-mitigation techniques, while significantly reducing turnover and trading costs, do not lead to improvements in net anomaly performance. Our findings have significant implications for academic research and practical investment strategy design. As we venture deeper into the age of machine learning and AI, studies such as ours will be crucial in navigating the complex labyrinth of returns, ultimately guiding us toward a better understanding of financial markets. 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4702406References Avramov, D., Cheng, S., and Metzker, L.

We report the impact in % change of the respective variable compared to the baseline model without mitigations.

Overview of Feedforward Neural Networks Architecture of FFNN with Two Hidden Layers In this study, FFNNs with two to five hidden layers are used. The architecture of an FFNN with two hidden layers is as follows: \u2022Input Layer: Receives input features (e.g., stock market anomalies, macroeconomic predictors, and industry dummies). \u2022First Hidden Layer: Applies a non-linear transformation to the inputs using the ReLU activation function. \u2022Second Hidden Layer: Further processes the data from the first hidden layer, also using ReLU. \u2022Output Layer: Produces the final output (e.g., asset return predictions), typically using a linear activation function. Mathematical Formulation with ReLU Activation Consider an FFNN with two hidden layers. The mathematical formulation using the ReLU activation function is: First Hidden Layer: H1=ReLU (W1\u00b7x+b1) (A.2) A1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4702406Second Hidden Layer: H2=ReLU (W2\u00b7H1+b2) (A.3) Output Layer: \u02c6y=f(W3\u00b7H2+b3) (A.4) where: \u2022xis the input vector. \u2022W1,W2,W3are the weight matrices for the first hidden layer, second hidden layer, and output layer, respectively. \u2022b1,b2,b3are bias vectors for each corresponding layer. \u2022ReLU (\u00b7)is the Rectified Linear Unit activation function, defined as ReLU (z) =max(0,z). \u2022f(\u00b7)is typically a linear activation function for regression tasks. ReLU Activation Function The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is defined as: ReLU (z) =max(0,z) (A.5) ReLU introduces non-linearity in the model, enabling the network to learn complex patterns. It is computationally efficient and helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. Backpropagation and Initialization of Weights and Biases Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm in supervised learning used for training Feed- forward Neural Networks (FFNNs). The core idea of backpropagation is to adjust the network\u2019s weights and biases to minimize the error between the predicted and actual outputs. Mathemati- cally, this involves computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the network.",

        "content": "Let\u2019s consider a network with Llayers, each with weights W(l)and biases b(l)for layerl. The process of backpropagation can be described as follows: 1.Forward Pass: Compute the output of the network for a given input.

For regression tasks, a common loss function is Mean Squared Error (MSE): L=1 NN/summationdisplay i=1(\u02c6yi\u2212yi)2(A.7) 3.Backward Pass: Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias.

A common approach to initializing weights and biases is to use small random values for weights and zeros for biases. This breaks the symmetry in the learning process and allows the network to learn effectively. For example, weights can be initialized from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a small standard deviation, e.g., 0.01. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks LSTMs are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data, which is particularly useful in financial time series forecasting. Core Components An LSTM unit includes several gates to control the flow of information: \u2022Forget Gate: Decides what information to discard from the cell state. \u2022Input Gate: Updates the cell state with new information.

We introduce a straightforward VWAP-based day trading strategy, which initiates long positions when price is above the VWAP and short positions when it falls below the VWAP. Our analysis employs QQQ and TQQQ as primary trading instruments, covering the period from January 2, 2018, to September 28, 2023. This timeframe includes two bear markets and multiple high-volatility events, providing a comprehensive test of market variations. Our findings reveal that an initial investment of $25,000 in the VWAP Trend Trading strategy with QQQ would have grown to $192,656, net of commissions, yielding a 671% return. This perfor- mance is marked by a maximum drawdown of just 9.4% and a Sharpe Ratio of 2.1. In contrast, a passive buy-and-hold strategy in QQQ during the same period would have returned 126%, with a significantly higher maximum drawdown of 37% and a lower Sharpe Ratio of 0.7. Further enhancing our strategy with TQQQ (3x leveraged ETFs of QQQ), we observed extraordinary outcomes: a $25,000 invest- ment surged to $2,085,417, net of commissions. This equates to an 8,242% total return, or an average annual return of 116%, maintaining a maximum drawdown comparable to the passive QQQ strategy. Although we do not regard it as a fully developed trading system, our findings highlight VWAP\u2019s potential as a powerful tool for active traders and investors, emphasizing its superiority over standard buy- and-hold approaches in terms of profitability, risk-adjusted returns, and resilience during market fluctuations. Keywords: Day Trading, Volume Weighted Average Price, VWAP, Day Trading Systems, QQQ, TQQQ 1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=46313511 Introduction The world of day trading is rife with debates and discussions, often revolving around the most effective strategies and if day trading can be a long term, consistent and un- correlated source of income. In the recent years especially after COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, day trading has captivated the imagination of many retail traders seeking to profit from market volatility, but its long-term viability remains a subject of ongo- ing discussion within the financial community [1, 2, 3, 4]. We previously investigated the validity of day trading with a well-known 5-minute Opening Range Breakout (ORB) strategy during the period of 2016 to 2023 [5]. That period encompassed two bear mar- kets and a few events with abnormal volatility. Our results suggested that with the proper use of leverage or leveraged products (such as 3x leveraged ETFs), day trading can significantly outperform a standard buy and hold portfolio on benchmark indexes in the US public equity markets (Nasdaq or NYSE). For example, between 2016 and 2023, a portfolio of $25,000 actively trading ORB on TQQQ would have earned an outstand- ing return of 1,484% while an investment in the QQQ ETF would have earned only 169%. In recent years, the realm of algorithmic trading has witnessed significant advancements in the development of trading strategies that seek to harness the power of data analytics and market insights [6]. One such strategy that has gained prominence is the use of the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) as a benchmark and basis for intraday trading decisions [7]. The Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is a financial metric used to determine the average price of a security, such as stocks, over a given period (usually intraday), taking into account both the price and the volume of trades during that pe- riod. This indicator provides a comprehensive reflection of the market\u2019s price action, as it integrates volume data to emphasize periods with higher trading activity. By doing so, VWAP offers a more precise measure of a security\u2019s average price compared to simple average price calculations, which do not account for variations in trading volume.",

VWAP is often used by traders and investors to assess the average price at which a stock has been traded throughout the day, taking into account the varying levels of trading ac- tivity. The VWAP is considered one of the most important indicators for active trading due to its ability to provide valuable insights into market trends and price action. Institutions and traders often pay close attention to VWAP for several reasons: 1.Reflects Market Liquidity : VWAP takes into account both the price and vol- ume of trades over a specific time period, usually the trading day. This means it provides a weighted average price that reflects not only the price levels but also the liquidity or trading activity at those levels. High-volume trades have more influence on VWAP than low-volume trades, making it a useful metric for gauging market sentiment. [8, 9] 2.Execution Benchmark : Institutional traders use VWAP as a benchmark for their trade executions. By comparing the execution price of their trades to the VWAP, they can assess whether they achieved better or worse prices relative to the overall market conditions. This helps them evaluate their trading strategies and performance. VWAP execution orders represent around 50% of all the institutional investors\u2019 trading. [7] 3.Intraday Trend Analysis : VWAP can be used to identify intraday trends. If the current market price is consistently above the VWAP, it suggests a bullish sentiment, while prices below VWAP indicate a bearish sentiment. Traders often look for opportunities to go long when the price is above VWAP and short when it\u2019s below. [10] 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=46313514.Support and Resistance Levels : VWAP can act as dynamic support or resis- tance levels during the trading day. Traders may use VWAP to identify potential entry or exit points based on whether the price is moving above or below it. [11] In this study, we embark on an exploration of the reliability of VWAP as a tool to identify market imbalances and subsequent market trends. The primary goal of this re- search paper is to assess whether the distance of current price versus VWAP offers a valuable indicator for future price moves. The subsequent obvious step (in case VWAP passed the test) would be to create an intraday VWAP-based trading system that aims to yield meaningful results in terms of profitability and risk-adjusted return. We aim to investigate the effectiveness of this strategy across various market conditions, seeking to understand its potential strengths and limitations. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of historical data and employing statistical methods, we endeavor to contribute valuable insights to the field of algorithmic trading and provide practical guidance for traders and investors. To be consistent with previous published papers, we conducted our analysis using QQQ and TQQQ, two very liquid ETFs tracking the famous Nasdaq100 index. It is important to mention that this study remains exploratory in nature. Past successes with a strategy do not serve as a guarantee of future profitability. Our aim is not to offer definitive prescriptions for trading success but to encourage further investigation and innovation within the trading and quantitative analysis community. We hope to inspire traders and quant analysts to delve deeper into this subject and insights derived from this study serve as a springboard for more extensive research endeavors, ultimately contributing to the collective knowledge of intraday trading strategies and enhancing the toolkit available to traders and investors. It is our hope that this exploration into a simple VWAP-based day trading system sparks interest, fosters collaborative inquiry, and inspires a new wave of research aimed at uncovering innovative and effective trading strategies.

But does the fact that market participants have been net buyers in the early part of the regular trading session2imply that they would continue to be net buyers in the subsequent part of the regular trading session, and vice versa too? Essentially, does the price traded above or below VWAP intraday have any meaningful trend identification capacity or not? In order to investigate this, we study how the market behaves based on where it has traded versus VWAP. The simplest way to run this test is to create two groups of 1-minute can- dles based on the sign of the difference between the previous candle\u2019s closure and VWAP. The first group, named Above VWAP , would be constituted by all the 1-minute candles whose previous 1-minute candle closure was Above VWAP . The second group, named Below VWAP , would be constituted by all the 1-minute candles whose previous 1-minute candle closure was Below VWAP . To make this clear, we created Figure 1 where group Above VWAP is colored blue while group Below VWAP is colored yellow. On January 2, 2018, the first day of our database, QQQ opened at $156.50. On Septem- ber 28, 2023, the last day of our database, QQQ closed at $358.01. During the 5-year period, QQQ repriced higher by approximately $202 ( $358.01 minus $156.50) per share3. The increase in price occurred for approximately $98 during regular trading hours (RTH, i.e., 9:30 AM\u20134:00 PM ET) and for approximately $104 outside regular trading hours (i.e., in pre-market 4:00 AM\u20139:30 AM ET and in post-market 4:00 PM\u20138:00 PM ET). 1Before 2018 TQQQ was not largely traded, and 1-minute data were partially missing. This would have affected the VWAP computation. 2Regular Trading Hours (RTH) is between 9:30am until 4:00pm ET. 3Excluding dividend 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351Figure 1: Example of an intraday chart of QQQ illustrating the concepts of what \u201cAbove VWAP\u201d and \u201cBelow VWAP\u201d mean. The only line in the chart is the VWAP, excluding pre- and post-market data. The 1-minute candlesticks above VWAP are colored blue (appearing dark in black and white printed editions), and the 1-minute candlesticks below VWAP are colored yellow (appearing brighter in black and white editions). The overall upward trend of QQQ is confirmed by the percentage of 1-minute candles that closed above VWAP; approximately 56% of 1-minute candles closed above VWAP while approximately 44% of 1-minute candles closed below VWAP. If we sum all the 1-minute changes4for candles that belong to the group Above VWAP , we obtain the dollar repricing of QQQ when it was trading above VWAP during regular trading hours. If we sum all the 1-minute changes for candles that belong to the group Below VWAP , we obtain the dollar repricing of QQQ when it was trading below VWAP during regular trading hours. Figure 2 shows that when QQQ was trading Above VWAP , it repriced higher by approx- imately $320, while it repriced lower by approximately $280 when it was trading Below VWAP5. 4A 1-minute dollar change is computed by taking the difference between the closing price of candle t and the closing price of candle t-1. 5An attentive reader will notice that the sum of the repricing will not equal the repricing that occurred during regular trading hours. This is due to the fact that the first 1-minute candle of each trading session cannot be categorized as either Above VWAP orBelow VWAP since there is no VWAP available from the previous 1-minute close. 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351Figure 2: Comparative repricing of a single share of QQQ from January 2, 2018, to September 28, 2023, delineated by trading periods and VWAP benchmarks.

        "content": "Above VWAP and Below VWAP denote periods when QQQ was trading above or below the Volume Weighted Average Price, respectively. This empirical analysis, based on historical data, indicates that when QQQ was subject to buying pressure, evidenced by its price trading above the VWAP, it tended to maintain that buying pressure in the minutes that followed. Conversely, when QQQ was subject to selling pressure, with its price trading below the VWAP, it tended to continue experi- encing selling pressure in the subsequent minutes. Given our recognition of the importance of price location relative to intraday VWAP in indicating imbalances in price movements, two critical questions emerge. First, how can traders or an algorithmic trading system leverage these insights to develop an active day trading strategy that utilizes VWAP to exploit intraday market imbalances? Second, can 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351this system significantly outperform the traditional buy-and-hold approach, especially when factoring in the commissions and fees associated with active trading? These ques- tions guided us in formulating a novel trend trading strategy based on VWAP, which is detailed in the next section. 3 Strategy Definition: VWAP Trend Trading The goal of the strategy is to position the portfolio according to the prevailing market imbalance, as measured by the difference between the current price and the last available VWAP. The portfolio maintains a long exposure when QQQ is trading above the VWAP and reverses its exposure when the price of QQQ moves below the VWAP. No positions are held overnight. 3.1 Entry Conditions, Stop Loss and Profit Target The system waits for the first 1-minute candle to close after the U.S. market opens at 9:30am ET. At exactly 9:31:00am ET if the price of the asset is above the VWAP (not including pre- or post-market trading hours) a long (buy) position is initiated. The strat- egy includes setting a stop loss at the price level where a 1-minute candle closes below VWAP. The position is held throughout the trading day, with the aim of closing it at the market\u2019s close price at 4pm ET. Similarly, if the first 1-minute candle opens below VWAP, the system enters a short (sell) position at the start of the following 1-minute candle. In this case, the strategy sets a stop loss at the price level where a 1-minute candle closes above VWAP, as conceptually illustrated in Figure 1. The position is maintained throughout the trading day, either until it gets stopped out or until it closes at the market\u2019s close price at 4pm ET. 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=46313513.2 Multiple Trade Occurrences Apart from the first minute of the trading session and outside regular trading hours, the strategy always implied an open position, either long or short. This would likely result in multiple trades in each trading session. 3.3 Position sizing In this method, position size for each trade is determined by utilizing all available equity without the use of any leverage. Whenever we enter into a position, the Risk-to-Reward (R:R) ratio for the trade is unknown; in fact the stop is not fixed and depends on the time-varying VWAP. As a consequence, we cannot employ a position sizing approach typically used by traders based on a fixed risk percentage such as 0.5% or 1% per trade [3, 4, 12]. Consequently, our approach is centered around using 100% of available funds for position sizing. This ensures that the entire available capital is allocated to each trade, addressing the uncertainty surrounding the Risk to Reward ratio. 3.4 Slippage and Commissions Since we initiated our system with a small account of only $25,000, we assumed no slip- page in our order fills. As our accounts in this paper grew significantly, reaching around $2 million, we recognize the potential for slippage to occur. However, based on our study of instruments such as QQQ and TQQQ, we believe that there is reasonably enough liquidity and trading volume in the market at any given time during trading day, making this assumption reasonably valid for smaller accounts. Nonetheless, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that as account sizes increase, slippage can be- come a more significant concern.",

These figures provide real examples of QQQ price actions and demonstrate how they can trigger our system. They serve as illustrative scenarios only to help readers visualize the system\u2019s operation. It is worth mentioning that a trader could implement the same strategy using a different timeframe, for example using 5-minutes candles. Figure 3 shows a scenario of how our strategy would have worked on November 10, 2023. The system waits for 1 minute, and then, since the 1-minute candle at 9:31am is below VWAP, it triggers a short trade, but it is stopped out soon. Trade 2 is long and gets stopped out when a 1-minute candlestick closes below VWAP. Trades 3 to 7 are quickly stopped-out, with each trade exiting as a candlestick closes below or above VWAP. Trade 8 happens when QQQ\u2019s price squeezes above VWAP and continues during the day until the Close. In this example, the number of candlesticks on the 1-minute chart doesn\u2019t exactly illustrate the full trading hours, but on November 10, 2023, QQQ never crossed VWAP after 11am, which shows Trade 8 held all the way to the close. Another example is illustrated in Figure 4 where the system wait 1 minute after the mar- ket Open at 9:30am. At 9:31am, since we have a candlestick above VWAP, even though that candlestick is a red candle, we initiate a long trade until it gets stopped out later when the price crosses below VWAP. Then, Trade 2 is initiated, which is a quick trade that results in stopping out because the price closes below VWAP and then suddenly squeezes back above VWAP. Trades 3, 4 and 5 are also short-lived trades until Trade 6 6We observed that significantly higher commission rates can affect the strategy\u2019s effectiveness. There- fore, we recommend that traders without access to comparable commission rates conduct further inves- tigation. 10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351Figure 3: Scenario Illustration of QQQ Price Action on 1-Minute Chart (November 10, 2023) This figure displays the QQQ price action on a 1-minute chart on 10 November, 2023, illustrating how the VWAP strategy outlined in this paper operates.

It\u2019s essential to emphasize that if the price crosses VWAP but the candlestick does not close below or above VWAP, we do not exit the position. We only exit the position if the candlestick closes above or below VWAP, ensuring a more robust risk management approach. 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351Figure 4: Scenario Illustration of QQQ Price Action on 1-Minute Chart (November 8, 2023) In this figure, we present a scenario on a 1-minute chart to illustrate how the VWAP strategy works in a specific context.

The financial superiority of the active strategy is remarkable: a day trading account starting with $25,000 on January 1st, 2018, would have appreciated to $192,656 (net of commis- sions) by September 28th, 2023.

To further gauge the outperformance of the active strategy in excess of market risk (or benchmark risk), we ran the following regression8on daily returns: RetV WAP TT=\u03b1+\u03b2\u00d7RetQQQ (2) 7The Sharpe Ratio, often used interchangeably with the Information Ratio in practice, quantifies the performance of a trading strategy by comparing its average annualized return to its annualized volatility. This ratio provides insight into the amount of profit generated per unit of risk. By using the average annualized return and annualized volatility, it allows investors to evaluate and compare the efficiency of strategies with differing risk and return profiles, offering a straightforward metric for strategy selection. 8The alpha can be interpreted as the return of the strategy in excess of the market risk. The beta component describes the correlation of the strategy returns with respect to passive QQQ returns. 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351Table 1: Performance comparison between a QQQ buy-and-hold portfolio and a portfolio engaged in day trading, both long and short positions on QQQ, using the VWAP-based system described in this paper.

The beta coefficient is not statistically different from zero, which implies that our active approach was not correlated with the benchmark. This allows the active strategy to ex- ploit two significant bear markets (the COVID-19 bear market and the 2022 bear market triggered by inflation concerns and rising interest rates) and the bullish environments that came after the economic stimulus during COVID-19. We believe that the trading rules underpinning the active VWAP Trend Trading portfolio render the strategy exceptionally effective during periods of extreme fear or exuberance. It is precisely during these times that significant demand or supply imbalances can spark pronounced intraday trends. An additional established metric for evaluating the risk of two strategies is the Maximum Drawdown (MDD). The MDD quantifies the largest percentage drop a portfolio has en- countered over a specified period. In our analysis, the VWAP Trend Trading strategy underwent a MDD of around 10% in early 2019, whereas the passive portfolio tracking QQQ endured a MDD exceeding 35% in 2022. This indicates that, during its most chal- lenging phase, the VWAP Trend Trading strategy\u2019s drawdown was three times less severe than that of the passive QQQ investment. If a passive investor is comfortable with a 35% Maximum Drawdown (MDD), would it not be wiser to engage in a VWAP Trend Trading strategy with threefold leverage? Such a strategy is likely to exhibit similar drawdown profiles while offering the possibil- ity of substantially higher returns. In the next section we investigate how the VWAP 14 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351Table 2: Performance comparison between a QQQ buy-and-hold portfolio, a TQQQ buy-and-hold portfolio and a portfolio engaged in day trading, both long and short positions on QQQ and TQQQ, using the VWAP-based system described in this paper.

Using the VWAP Trend Trading rules described before, we run a backtest using 1-minute data for TQQQ. The results are even more astounding. With the use of TQQQ the resulting portfolio can achieve a remarkable level of returns, as depicted in Figure 6 and summarized in Table 2. The total return for active TQQQ now stands at an impressive 8,242%, with an average yearly return of 116%. A portfolio starting with $25,000 on January 2, 2018, would have appreciated to $2,085,417 (net of commissions) by September 28, 2023.

In line with our intentions, the Maximum Drawdown increased to 36.1%, which is one percentage point higher than those experienced by a passive buy and hold investor. 9TQQQ is one of the largest ETFs with assets under management of $13.13 billion (as of March 21, 2023). Due in part to QQQ\u2019s popularity, issuers of leveraged ETFs have tapped traders\u2019 thirst for more exotic ways to play the Nasdaq-100. TQQQ\u2019s objective is simple: to deliver triple the daily returns of the Nasdaq-100. Therefore, if that index rises by 1% on a particular day, TQQQ should jump by 3%. As is the case with any leveraged ETF, TQQQ is an instrument best used over intraday time frames, not as a buy and hold investment. Investors and traders who do not consider themselves \u201cactive\u201d and \u201crisk-tolerant\u201d should eschew leveraged ETFs. 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351Figure 6: Performance comparison between a QQQ buy-and-hold portfolio, a portfolio engaged in day trading, both long and short positions on QQQ based on 1-min candlestick using the VWAP-based system described in this paper and a portfolio of day trading TQQQ based on this approach.

Furthermore, the Sharpe Ratio remains strong at 1.7, nearly 2.5 times higher than the simple Buy & Hold on QQQ. This signifies that for the same amount of risk, the active TQQQ strategy produces a return that is 2.5 higher than what can be achieved with a passive QQQ position.

In this section, we investigate more in details the impact of commissions incurred during the backtested period that span from January 2, 2018 until September 28, 2023. As shown in Table 3, the VWAP day trading system on TQQQ starting with a capital of$25,000, concludes with a substantial profit exceeding $2 million, while incurring com- missions totaling $400,616. In contrast, the VWAP day trading system for QQQ, with a total commission of only $6,547, achieves an ending capital of $192,656. During the backtested period, the VWAP Trend Trading strategy on QQQ traded approximately 13 million shares, while the TQQQ version accounted for roughly 800 million shares traded. The active VWAP strategies incurred about 22,000 trades. It is important to note that the total number of trades is similar, though not exactly the same. This difference is due to the inherent variations in TQQQ\u2019s price movements.",

Such a ratio is typical for trend trading strategies that capitalize on intraday price movements. Despite the seemingly low accuracy, the strategy is balanced by a favorable positive asymmetry between gains and losses. On average, gains per trade are 5.5 times greater than the losses. During the backtested period, the most successful trade in the QQQ version yielded a return of 6.5% on the invested capital. In comparison, the TQQQ version, leveraging the same strategy, saw its highest single trade return surge to about 21%, nearly thrice that of QQQ. The worst trade recorded returns -1.4% for QQQ and -4.1% for TQQQ. Notably, the maximum daily gain for the VWAP trend trading portfolio in QQQ was 6.5%, while the most challenging day ended with a 5.1% loss, likely attributed to a mean- reverting day with numerous false VWAP breaks. For TQQQ, the extremes were even more pronounced: the best day saw a 20.9% gain, while the worst plummeted to a -22.7% loss, paralleling the QQQ experience on a mean-reverting day. Interestingly, despite deploying the same level of leverage as the active QQQ strategy, the Buy & Hold portfolio exhibited a maximum daily loss of -12.3% (the Nasdaq index dropped 12.3%, its largest percentage loss ever on 16 March 2020 because of Covid-19 pandemic), which is more than double the most substantial daily loss (-5.1%) in the QQQ VWAP Trend Trading portfolio. This observation underscores the potential risks and rewards inherent in these differing approaches to trading. 18 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=46313514 VWAP, the Holy Grail Indicator for Intraday Trend Trading? When it comes to intraday trading, active traders often rely on a variety of technical indicators to guide their decisions. Among the plethora of tools available, the Sim- ple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Donchian Channels, Keltner Bands, and the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) stand out as popular choices. The SMAs is particularly similar to the VWAP in that they all track price movements over time, which helps traders identify trends within specific timeframes. The SMA is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of a stock\u2019s price over a certain period. The critical distinction between SMA and the VWAP lies in the use of volume data. While the SMA solely consider price data, the VWAP also incorporates volume informa- tion, providing a more comprehensive view of the market. This volume data allows the VWAP to give a weighted average price that reflects both the price and the quantity of securities traded, which can be particularly valuable for assessing the market\u2019s direction within the trading day.",

Similar to pharmaceutical experiments where a study group is administered a drug and another group receives a placebo as a control group , we found it intriguing to determine whether the outperformance of our VWAP Day Trading System is primarily attributed to VWAP itself or if a system based on any moving average used for trend detection can significantly outperform a Buy and Hold strategy. Therefore, we conducted a comparison by considering four important and commonly used intraday moving averages: 9, 20, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMA). 19 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351Table 5: Summary Statistics for different Intraday Trend trading Strategies on QQQ from January 1, 2018, to September 28, 2023.

The VWAP day trading system consistently demonstrates significant outperformance over any day trading system that relies on moving averages as its trend trading signal. Notably, the strategy with the highest execution frequency is the SMA9, registering over 100,000 different trades. In contrast, the SMA100 and SMA200 strategies show a significant reduction in trade fre- quency, with approximately 31,000 and 22,000 trades, respectively. While faster moving averages exhibit better Hit Ratios, they also show a lower asymmetry between gains and losses. The exceptional performance of the VWAP Trend Trading portfolio is further under- scored if we consider that it has the highest average annualized return (43%) with the best Maximum Drawdown (9%). This implies that the VWAP Trend Trading portfolio was not only the most lucrative strategy but also the one that managed risk most effec- tively. These superior results achieved with our VWAP Trend Trading strategy can be attributed to several key factors: 1. Short-term moving averages (e.g., SMA9, SMA20) tend to generate numerous trad- ing signals that, over time, result in a significant amount of commission expenses. 2. Long-term moving averages (e.g., SMA100, SMA200) can be less effective during 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351the early part of the trading session, as they are often influenced by premarket prices with low-volume confirmation. 3. After a large intraday move, a sudden reversal sustained by volume will quickly trig- ger a reverse signal for the VWAP. This allows to protect unrealized gains. Trend portfolio built on SMA100 and SMA200 would be slower to react, and the reversal would erase a big portion of unrealized gains. 5 Time of Day and The Urgency to Act In previous sections, we have seen that VWAP is an effective trend trading indicator that can help active traders to efficiently ride intraday trends. Here we investigate if there are times of day when VWAP is more or less effective. To run this test, we grouped all the 1-minute PnLs occurred in the QQQ VWAP Trend Trading strategy10based on the time of day; for example, Group 1 is constituted by all the PnL occurred between 9:31am and 9:32am, Group 2 is constituted by all the PnL occurred between 9:32am and 9:33am, and so on. Then we sum all the 1-minute PnLs within each group. This would represent the overall strategy performance (per share) occurred from 2018 until 2023 in each minute of the day. As a final step, we take the cumulative sum of all these 1-minute overall repricing. The cumulative sum of the 1-minute PnL is exhibited in Figure 7. The overall profitabil- ity of a VWAP Trend Trading strategy that traded only 1 share of QQQ would have been approximately $60011.",

        "content": "As can be easily grasped from the chart, most of the profits came from the early part of the day (9:30am-12pm ET) and on the last hour of the trading session (3pm-4pm). This implies that a more cost-efficient implementation of the VWAP Trend trading strategy may avoid trading between 12pm and 3pm. Although delving into the economic reasons behind the time-of-day seasonality of the VWAP indicator falls outside the scope of this paper, we can outline some potential explanations for this phenomenon. As highlighted in the introduction of this paper, the 10For simplicity, the strategy trades always 1 share of QQQ. 11During the same period 1 share of QQQ repriced higher by approximately $200, see Figure 2. 21 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351Figure 7: Cumulative PnL analysis by Time-of-Day using the VWAP Trend Trading Strategy on a Single Share of QQQ, from January 2, 2018, to September 28, 2023. This analysis groups intraday PnL by each minute of the trading day. For each minute, we calculate the total PnL occurrences, followed by a cumulative sum. The chart\u2019s aim is to investigate potential intraday VWAP seasonality. Notably, during the morning session and the final trading hour, the price often trends in accordance with the VWAP direction (upward if above VWAP, downward if below). Conversely, the mid-session shows no significant trend characteristics. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) is utilized by institutional investors to assess the efficiency of executing large orders throughout the day. When a trader is tasked with executing a large order, whether buying or selling, they are confronted with two primary risks: the possibility of executing at a suboptimal price relative to the end-of-day VWAP, or the challenge of incomplete execution due to waiting for a more favorable price that ultimately does not materialize. Building on this premise, the following behaviors could explain the pattern observed in Figure 7: 1. During the initial phase of the trading session, a trader who anticipates the VWAP to exhibit a trending behavior throughout the day might be inclined to quickly execute his entire order as soon as the market begins to move with the VWAP\u2019s di- 22 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351rection. This could result in a positive feedback loop, intensifying the early session\u2019s movement, whether upwards or downwards. 2. Alternatively, a trader might choose to wait for a more advantageous price following a significant early session move. If, however, the price does not revert to the VWAP during the midday period, the trader may be compelled to act in the final trading hour to complete his order. This urgency could exert additional pressure on the stock, leading to a pronounced trend in alignment with the VWAP\u2019s direction. 6 Conclusion Our research, covering the period from January 2, 2018, to September 28, 2023, com- pellingly demonstrates the superiority of the VWAP-based trading strategy over con- ventional buy-and-hold methods. The VWAP Trend Trading strategy applied to QQQ achieved a remarkable 671% return (net of commissions), with a maximum drawdown of 9.4% and an impressive Sharpe ratio of 2.1. This period, which includes two bear mar- kets and several instances of abnormal volatility, provides a robust test of the strategy\u2019s resilience. In comparison, during the same period, a buy-and-hold strategy on QQQ yielded a total return of 126%, along with a maximum drawdown of 37%, a maximum daily loss of 12%, and a Sharpe ratio of 0.7. Extending the strategy to TQQQ resulted in an extraordinary 8,242% return, amounting to an average yearly return of 116%. Notably, this approach achieved a similar maximum drawdown as a passive QQQ investment, highlighting its effectiveness in risk management while amplifying returns. While the study highlights the potential challenges, such as the impact of commissions and the frequency of trades, the overall performance and risk-adjusted returns of the VWAP-based strategy remain notably superior. 23 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4631351This research reaffirms the significance of VWAP in intraday trading over the speci- fied period and encourages further exploration into algorithmic strategies. As a result, this paper serves as a critical resource for traders and quantitative analysts, providing a statistically robust and empirically validated approach to enhance trading methodologies.",

By analyzing the article, we can suggest that the stock prices of three companies grew up, it would be a good investment at the beginning of January, but now stock prices are high, which could be overvalued in the market. From our assumption, we can say that these stocks are pro\ufb01table in the short term, however, we should be careful in case we are going to invest in the long term prospective.

How scientists say that a new disease is not a little thing since it can stop customers\u2019 spending and demands to products, shut down factories, bother supply chain and damage sentiment. On the other hand, the market reacts for each bad news by decreasing major indexes. Investment Focus : We are going to analyze industries which are doing great in an era of Coronavirus outbreak: 1. Online entertainment (movies, games): Net\ufb02ix, HBO, Gaming platforms; 2. Online education or online job market (Zoom/Skype/Dingding/ATT/Verizon); 3. Food Industry; 4. Healthcare. 2ONLINE SERVICES 2.1Online entertainment Recent global coronavirus outbreak made millions of people prizoned at their houses. This resulted in the popularization of in-homeentertainmentservices.So,companiessuchasNet\ufb02ix,HBO,AmazonPrimeVideoandYoutubebroadcastingchannels are bene\ufb01cial and playing on the other side of the global crisis court. Firstly, Net\ufb02ix (Appendix 1.1.) has really bene\ufb01ted from the pandemic outbreak since it is the easiest way to entertain home-stay people. This can be backed up by the stock price performance. We analyzed the historical prices for NFLX for the last two months (to be exact since January, 10th, 2020 - the day when the coronavirus was announced). If we look at the prices we could see a general upward trend starting from January, Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3567445AUTHOR ONE ET AL 3 10,2020thatisademonstrationsupportshowingthecorrect\ufb02owoflogicthathome-stayentertainmentisdoingwellinglobal crisis times.

So, we could forecast a price increase in the nearest future. The second thing which is analyzed is that we consider Net\ufb02ix as an evolutionary business unit, since it is not something absolutely new, because TV broadcasting hasbeenalreadydevelopedwhenNet\ufb02ixenteredthismarket.Also,lookingatthecoststructureinthebusinessmodel,about62 percentrelatedtocostsofrevenue,whichis,actually,consideredasnotadesirableproportionforthefutureinvestmentdecision making.So,inthiscaseitwon\u2019tbesomethingattractivefortheinvestorinthelong-term,however,intheshort-termduringthe coronavirus outbreak it could be a reasonable investment with high return. 2.1.1Video Gaming The second home-stay entertainment that is very popular among young people staying at home is video games. According to the recent barrons\u2019 statistics the number of users of the game named \u201cHonors of King\u201d surpassed 100 million people at the Lunar New Year in China.

Some of the schools are trying to launch their own online education system, but others choose to use online conference platforms such as RTX Meeting by Tencent, and Zoom, Skype, which is a major usage of such platforms and has boosted their stock price recently to some extent. Such trends are regarded by some experts as not just an expedient solution or an alternative to physical education but a long-run improvement and upgrade of online education infrastructure and technology.

Zoom Video Communications Inc.\u2019s shares are steadily growing in the last two months. Zoom o\ufb00ers online services such as video meetings, voice webinars, and chat across your desktop. The stock increased by 47percent in the last month, when companiesencouraged employeesto workfrom homes.If theglobal situationwill notchange, themore companiesstart touse this platform. For instance, JPMorgan said that it is too early to predict Zoom Inc.\u2019s success because, most of the companies connecting through a free app, and it is unclear whether they can be switch paying ones. The stock has scored the biggest increase from the disease; however, the company was performing very poorly before the coronavirus outbreak. If we look the article from a stock watch is says that Zoom shows net income 15.3 million, or 5 cents a share, for the quarter, compared with net income of 1.2 million, or 1 cent a share, in the year-ago fourth quarter. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 15 cents. If we analyze the data: Revenue grew to 188.3 dollars million from 105.8 which is a 78 percent percent increase, which is more than analytics were predicting.

Firstly, we get the quarterly ISM index and its moving average from 1995 to 2019. If the moving average for ISM this quarter is larger than the moving average for ISM last quarter, then we de\ufb01ne the growth up; meanwhile, if the moving average for ISM this quarter is smaller than the moving average for ISM last period, we suppose the growth down. As for the CPI part, we also use moving average to determine the in\ufb02ation up or down. If the moving average for CPI this period is larger than the moving average for CPI this period is larger than the moving average for CPI last quarter, then there is in\ufb02ation up. Otherwise, we suppose that the in\ufb02ation is down. The table below shows our de\ufb01nition about the four phases.

However, there is still a debate whether any of the described trends are a revolutionary innovation or just evolutionary. For example, according to Diwan (2018) cryptocurrency by itself refers to revolutionary tech- nologies since it has a game-changing impact on the money perception itself.

Here are our results: Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3567445AUTHOR ONE ET AL 15 As we can see, the daily returns for Zoom is a stationary process and the mean is approximately zero. After March 2020, the volatility of the returns increased tremendously due to the outbreak of the COVID-19. 6.1.2Moving Average Score System Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=356744516 AUTHOR ONE ET AL We compared the adjacent moving average windows and add 1 for the higher window to its score every day. Above is an example result of our system. For example, on 2020-05-07, the 12-day moving average return is bigger than both the 10-day moving average return and 15-day moving average return, so the score for 12-day moving average return is 2. And, the 15-day movingaveragereturnisbiggerthan20-daymovingaveragereturnbutlessthan12-daymovingaveragereturn,sothescorefor the 15-day moving average return is only 1. Using this system, we calculate the sum of the scores for all the 152 trading days within this period, and we get the total score as follows: So in our strategy, we use 5 as short window and 20 as long window to calculate the moving average returns. 6.1.3Our trading strategy: \u000fStrategy Overview Givencurrentmarketconditionsandincreaseinvolatilitywemaybeabletotakeadvantageofasimpleshort/longstrategywith the following entry and exit parameters. Generally, if the short moving average return is larger than the long moving average return on each days, it is a buy signal and we should have a long position in Zoom\u2019s stock. Otherwise, it is a sell signal and we should short Zoom\u2019s stock.",

It is essentially a number that describes the rate at which an investment would have grown if it had grown the same rate every year and the pro\ufb01ts were reinvested at the end of each year.

        "content": "Evaluating LLMs in Financial Tasks - Code Generation in Trading Strategies Miquel Noguer i Alonso, Hanane Dupouy Artificial Intelligence Finance Institute March 9, 2024 1 Abstract In this paper, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of various Large Language Models (LLMs) for their efficacy in generating Python code specific to algorithmic trading strategies. Our study encompasses a broad spectrum of LLMs, including GPT-4-Turbo, Gemini-Pro, Mistral, Llama2, and Codellama, assessing their performance across a series of task-specific prompts designed to elicit precise code implementations for over various technical indicators commonly used in the financial trading sector. A principal component of our methodology involves the creation of a detailed prompt struc- ture that adapts to the unique capabilities of each LLM. For OpenAI\u2019s Assistant AI, we leverage an intricate prompt design that integrates templated responses, zero-shot task- specific prompts, and prompt chaining to guide the models through a step-by-step reasoning process, ensuring the generation of executable and accurate Python code. This structured approach not only facilitates the model\u2019s comprehension of the task at hand but also allows for the nuanced adaptation of prompts to cater to the distinct processing styles of different LLMs. Our evaluation framework is grounded in a comparison against baseline results obtained from widely recognized libraries such as TALib, as well as a comprehensive Python implementa- tion of the indicators. Through a meticulous process of parsing our code and constructing data frames that encapsulate function names, parameters, and documentation, we establish a foundational prompt that prompts LLMs to propose viable Python code implementations. This zero-shot task-specific approach is crucial in enabling the LLMs to methodically navi- gate through the tasks, thereby enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the generated code. The findings indicate that GPT-4-Turbo, Codellama-70B, and Gemini-Pro yield encouraging results relative to baseline computations, with GPT-4-Turbo achieving identical implemen- tations to the baseline in certain instances. 2 Literature and References The references used for this paper are: \u2022ta-lib-python, is a Python wrapper for TA-LIB, which is based on Cython rather than SWIG. TA-LIB itself is widely used by trading software developers who need to perform technical analysis of financial market data. This Python wrapper allows for the utilization of over 150 indicators, including ADX, MACD, RSI, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, and many others, directly in Python environments. This project enables users to apply technical analysis techniques and indicators to financial market data efficiently within their Python applications, providing a critical tool for the development of trading strategies and analytical models [Benediktsson, ] \u2022ReplicateMeta [Replicate, a] \u2022ReplicateMistral [Replicate, b] \u2022StockCharts [StockCharts.com, ] 1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4752797\u2022PromptChainer: Chaining Large Language Model Prompts through Visual Program- ming\u201d discusses an interface and methodology for creating complex applications by chaining prompts of large language models (LLMs). It addresses the challenge of executing multi-step tasks that a single LLM prompt cannot handle efficiently. By enabling the chaining of prompts where the output of one prompt serves as the input for the next, it facilitates the building of more complex and nuanced AI-driven appli- cations. This approach also aids in debugging and refining the AI\u2019s output at various stages of the process, making it more transparent and controllable for users, particu- larly those who are not AI experts. The study highlights user needs for transforming data between steps and debugging chains, proposing a solution through a visually programmed interface designed to make the process more intuitive and accessible.

In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain of thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking.",

[Wei et al., 2023] 3 Methodology We introduce an empirical framework to evaluate the LLMs in their ability to generate correct Python code for algorithmic trading strategies. The trading strategies evaluated comprise momentum and trend following categories. Some examples of the evaluated indicators are Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), RSI (Relative Strength Index) or Stochastic Oscillator. The LLM\u2019s python code implementation is then compared to a baseline implementation from the TALIB library or our own code implementation (which has the same results as the TALIB one). For information about the indicators, visit [StockCharts.com, ]. The goal is to assess if the model provides the right implementation of the strategy, the same way is coded in TAlib library [Benediktsson, ]. 3.1 Large Language Models (LLMs) We used various LLMs in our experiments: For GPT-4-Turbo we used OpenAI API, and their Assistant API which allows building AI assistants by leveraging different tools like code interpreter. We utilize the Google GenAI API to access the Gemini-pro model. We used Replicate API forLlama2-7b-chat, Llama2-13b-chat, Llama2-70b-chat , Codellama-7b-instruct, Codellama-13b-instruct ,Codellama-34b-instruct ,Codellama- 70b-instruct . We use it also for Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 and Mixtral-8x7b-instruct- v0.1. The various versions used for each model are included in Appendix A . 3.2 Code Generation We provided the LLMs with various prompt designs, to generate a Python code for a specified trading strategy. Subsequently, we compared the performance of these generated implementations with that of a standard library. Both the LLM-generated and library-based codes were then executed (where possible) using historical price data for a specific financial instrument. See Appendix B for an example of a generated python code for Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator by GPT-4-Turbo. The accuracy of the generated code is then assessed using the methodology described in the evaluation part. 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=47527974 What Prompt Design for what LLM? In our evaluation of various LLMs across different APIs, it becomes necessary to tailor our prompt techniques to suit each model\u2019s unique characteristics and capabilities. While utilizing the OpenAI API, we leverage its extensive array of tools and features to facilitate code execution, file storage, and comparison. This necessitates customizing our prompts to align with the capabilities and nuances of this environment. However, with other APIs such as GenAI and Replicate, we employ different prompts tailored to the more straightforward interaction these models offer. 4.1 OpenAI API Various features and tools are available in OpenAI API such as files uploading and Assistant AI API. With OpenAI, you can upload your historical prices file. The Assistant AI provides a suite of tools, such as a code interpreter, enabling you to write code and request its execution directly. Consequently, you can direct the assistant to execute your Python code on the uploaded file and store all requisite files within the OpenAI framework, accessible at any time. Furthermore, the assistant also maintains a record of conversation history, which is utilized to interact with the various results. Given these capabilities, we employed a combination of three distinct prompt tech- niques . 1 \u2013 At the time of creating the assistant, we designed a prompt with an initial set of instructions, which we refer to as the \u2019templated response\u2019 . 2 \u2013 Within the conversation thread with the assistant, we applied two prompt techniques: zero-shot task-specific prompts and prompt chaining . The introduction of the \u201ctemplated response\u201d technique involves the use of predefined sentences or phrases that the assistant uses to indicate the status of its response or process- ing. This approach helps in managing and interpreting the flow of communication, especially in asynchronous or multi-step interactions. By using specific templates or signals, both the user and the system can more easily under- stand the current state of the task at hand, whether it\u2019s complete, in progress, or encoun- tering issues. As the assistant breaks down the answers across different streams, it\u2019s essential to ascertain when it delivers a comprehensive answer and when the tasks requested have either failed or not been fulfilled.",

        "content": "Therefore we have instructed the assistant to respond with a specific predefined set of sen- tences for certain types of answers encountered: For example: 1. Upon completing an answer, conclude with this statement: \u201cThe response is complete.\u201d 2. If you are unable to complete the answer and require additional time, append this statement to your intermediate responses: \u201cProcessing incomplete, I\u2019m still thinking. Please stand by.\u201d 3. Should you encounter the word \u201cApolog\u201d within your message, conclude the answer with: \u201cProcessing incomplete, I encounter issues. Please stand by.\u201d 4. If you have been asked to generate files but they have not been produced, end your response with: \u201cProcessing incomplete, files not yet generated. Please stand by.\u201d Employing this prompt technique enables us to identify when to stand by and when to prompt the assistant to revisit the task that hasn\u2019t been completed. Thezero-shot task-specific prompts enable the LLM to tackle various small tasks step-by-step, such as \u201dreading the text\u201d, \u201dextracting the name of the algo\u201d, \u201dwhich type of algo it is\u201d, \u201dproposing a python implementation\u201d, \u201dstoring the data in a json file with given keys\u201d. This prompt design enabled the model to think step-by-step and improve its 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4752797accuracy in inferring the tasks. Theprompt chaining technique enables the LLM to break down tasks into several task-clusters, using the results from each task-cluster as input for the subsequent ones. This approach is designed to allow the LLM time to process information. 4.2 Gemini-Pro While employing a single-shot call to the GenAI API for accessing Gemini-Pro (with the methodology detailed subsequently), we adopt zero-shot task-specific prompt technique. 4.3 Other LLMs When invoking Llama2 [Replicate, a] and Mistral [Replicate, b], we apply the same prompt technique as used for Gemini-Pro: zero-shot task-specific . However, for Codellama and certain algorithms, we further condense the zero-shot task-specific prompts to enhance the LLM\u2019s comprehension of the instructions. 5 Evaluation Metrics Theprimary factor for assessment is the executability of the code. It was noted that some LLMs, when tasked with specific algorithmic strategies, generate code that fails to run. This issue persists even after multiple attempts. For instance, the generated code might include references to \u2019pd.rolling\u2019 or \u2019pd.Date,\u2019 which are not valid functions in the pandas library. This is known as hallucination. Thesecond evaluation , conducted after executing the code, involves using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. This step entails comparing the outcomes of the specified strategy, for which the LLM has proposed the code, against the baseline results, which could be derived from TALIB or our comprehensive implementation. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric computes the square root of the average squared error between the true values yiand predicted ones \u02c6 yi. The predicted ones being the values computed by the code proposed by the model. RMSE =vuut1 NNX i=1(yi\u2212\u02c6yi)2 Thethird evaluation involves effectively comparing the generated code. Some LLMs de- clare parameters in the function definition but fail to use them within the actual code. For instance, they might specify \u201cclose\u201d, \u201chigh\u201d, \u201clow\u201d as parameters, but in practice, only \u201cclose\u201d is utilized in the code. This does not render the code inexecutable, but it leads to highly inaccurate results. Some LLMs employ moving average methods that differ from those used in the base model. Some of these methods result in initial computation values that differ from those of the base algorithm. However, these values tend to converge with the base values over time. The details of these calculations will be thoroughly analyzed in the results section. 6 Prompting Framework To construct the primary prompt for our study, we first need to extract the relevant infor- mation pertaining to a specific trading strategy. Subsequently, we tailor the design of the prompts according to the LLM being evaluated. 6.1 Extracting data from our own code We have coded various algorithmic trading strategies using Python. These hand-coded strategies were tested against the ones from ta-lib library. This ensures that the results from the hand-coded strategies and ta-lib are the same. 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4752797Based on our own code: We extract all functions and store the information as a dataframe.",

In our case, we used the code interpreter tool which allows the model to write and exe- cute a Python code in a sandboxed execution environment. OpenAI offers various features including the ability to upload and store files, as well as the capability to generate and maintain files within OpenAI\u2019s system. To effectively uti- lize these features, we made calls to the Assistant API, requesting it to generate Python code, execute it on the uploaded file, and then produce and store the results in JSON and CSV files. Additionally, we asked it to plot graphs for result comparison and store these as well. See Appendix C which is describing the call steps adopted in the Assistant AI API. As the history of conversations is stored in memory within a thread used by a given as- sistant, employing certain prompt techniques becomes relevant and contributes significantly to the stability of the process for generating the requested python code and the necessary files. Prompt techniques such as zero-shot task-specific and prompt chaining, as previously explained, were then utilized. However we encountered some issues when trying to automate the calls. The LLM requires time to process information. To automate the process, we introduced a delay to ensure we could collect the final answers. At times, the responses can be misleading. To address this, we added extra safeguards and directives to the main prompt of the assistant to categorize the types of the responses. Depending on the response category, we would then take appropriate actions. For example, the LLM might confirm that the CSV file has been successfully generated and even provide the correct name as requested. However, upon checking the annotation object from the call where the file ID should be stored, it could be found to be empty. We called this prompt technique \u201ctemplated response\u201d, as previously explained. 6.2.1 Instructing the Assistant Refine the initial instructions using chat.completion: Before we started using the Assistant API, we refined our main prompt using the chat.completion method and GPT-3.5-Turbo model. The aim is to provide the assistant with clear instruc- tions through the use of templated responses . Example of the assistant AI prompt used in our study is included in Appendix D . With the new classification of responses, it became possible to take action by seeking further clarification or additional inputs from the model, thereby enhancing the robustness of the automated process. Furthermore, safeguard checks are implemented on the assistant\u2019s final responses to identify when files are missing, prompting a request for the model to generate them again. 6.2.2 Requesting the LLM to Suggest a Python Code Implementation of a Selected Strategy and Execute it Zero-shot task-specific prompt We extract the description of a strategy from our algorithms\u2019 dataframe, which was con- 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4752797structed using our code and yields results equal to those of the TAlib library. The following details are included in the strategy description: 1. Name of the Strategy 2. Name of our function 3. The parameters of the function Using this description, we construct our initial zero-shot task-specific prompt. This approach directs the model to provide precise responses by instructing it to employ step-by-step rea- soning in addressing various questions. We request the model to perform several tasks, including proposing a Python code imple- mentation and saving the information in a JSON file. Here is the prompt used in this step: 1 message_user = f\"\"\"From the following description: 2 ``` 3 {desc} 4 ``` 5 Let's think step-by-step and: 6 1. Extract the name of the trading algorithm 7 2.

Prompt chaining After receiving the final response and generating the JSON file, we issue a subsequent prompt instructing the model to run the provided code and save the computed indicator results in a CSV file for future use. We also guide the model through step-by-step reasoning, allowing it time to process and clarify the various tasks it needs to complete. The details of the prompt used in this step is included in Appendix E . This final response provides us with the strategy outcomes derived from the code sug- gested by the model. In the next section, we will ask the model to execute our own code. 6.2.3 Requesting the LLM to Run Our Own Code Build a prompt with our own code We single out the previously provided trading algorithm strategy name for the LLM, extract our unique code function, and incorporate it into the new prompt that will be given to the LLM. An example of a strategy is included in Appendix F . We guide the model using step-by-step task-specific requests, including executing our own code and saving the results.

However, since each execution of the code may produce CSV files with different names for the indicators, how can the system determine which columns from both files should be compared? This is the reason why the names and the number of columns from both files are stored. Using this data, a new prompt can be constructed to read the JSON files where the information is stored. Subsequently, the model can be instructed to conduct a similarity search for each pair of columns, excluding non-relevant ones such as date, close, open, high, etc. Therefore, the columns with the highest similarity can be identified, and the model can be asked to plot their figures and even calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between each relevant pair of columns. Here is a similarity comparison example related to Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) strategy: Different similarities have been used: Cosine-similarity, The modified Hamming distance and the Szymkiewicz-Simpson overlap coefficient.

        "content": "For example, when the indicators are named simply \u201cK\u201d and \u201cD\u201d as in the Stochastic Oscillator, the similarity score becomes irrelevant. 2 - Files are compared outside the OpenAI environment using the conventional method, which involves reading the files with pandas, comparing the pertinent columns and comput- ing the RMSE. 6.3 Building the main prompt for Gemini-pro We utilize the Google GenerativeAI API to access the Gemini-pro model. Although the API for this model includes a chat feature, we exclusively utilize the model.generate content method, which provides single-shot response and does not handle conversation history. The 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4752797reason for using this basic feature is that Gemini-pro API does not support code execution in a sandboxed environment, unlike OpenAI. We simply need to obtain the code suggested by Gemini-pro, convert it into a JSON object, store it for subsequent auditing, and then execute it. As described in GPT-4-Turbo section, in the prompt, we provide the name of the strategy, the name of our function, and the parameters. We request the LLM to generate a flat full python implementation of the chosen trading indicator by using a similar prompt to the one detailed in the zero-shot task-specific section of GPT-4-Turbo. It\u2019s important to give this description with the parameters, to constrain the LLM to use the same notation, to be able to execute the code without any additional transformations. In this prompt, we employed a zero-shot task-specific technique to allow the LLM to tackle one task at a time, providing it with the necessary time to process each step. You can find an example example of Gemini-pro answer in Appendix G . After receiving the LLM\u2019s response, despite specifically requesting a JSON object, we encountered issues loading it as such. This issue was encountered in almost all LLMs (Except GPT-4-Turbo). To address this, we made a call to the OpenAI API using the chat completion method and gpt-3.5-turbo, converting the response into a valid, loadable JSON format. This object was then saved, and the Python code executed locally, with the results stored accordingly. Following this, we execute the python code on the historical prices file and compute the RMSE against the base implementation. 6.4 Building the Main Prompt for the Other LLMs from Meta and Mistral We used Replicate API for llama2 (7b, 13b, 70b chat versions), codellama (7b, 13b, 34b, 70b instruct versions) and Mistral (7b, 8x7b instruct versions). Replicate is hosting Meta and Mistral LLMs among others. https://replicate.com/meta https://replicate.com/mistralai We construct a prompt similar to the one used in the Gemini-pro section but with fewer instructions. This adjustment is made because we\u2019ve observed that the codellama model sometimes has difficulty interpreting and understanding more complex instructions. We shorten even more the prompt when using codellama for some strategies. Similar to gemini-pro, we observed that the JSON object provided by these models is invalid. Consequently, an additional call to OpenAI\u2019s chat.completion method using gpt-3.5-turbo was necessary to create a valid JSON object, which could then be stored and executed. 7 Results We assessed six algorithmic trading strategies using the following models: GPT-4-Turbo, Gemini-pro, Llama2-7b-chat, Llama2-13b-chat, Llama2-70b-chat, Codellama-7b-instruct, Codellama-13b-instruct, Codellama-34b-instruct, Codellama-70b-instruct, Mistral-7b-instruct- v0.2, Mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1. The first phase of the assessment is dedicated to verifying the code\u2019s executability. Once confirmed that the code operates without issues, the subsequent phase entails calculating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to compare the performance of the baseline model against the output from the LLM. Armed with these findings, a comprehensive analysis will be undertaken to evaluate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), determining its significance in terms of being notably high or low. In Table 1 three levels of evaluation are considered: \u2022Whether the code is executable or not, 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4752797\u2022Whether the LLM implementation yields a single value (1, 0, NaN, or a floating-point number). In such cases, the response is inaccurate, and the evaluation cannot proceed. \u2022Whether the LLM uses the whole set of the mandatory parameters: high, low when the indicator needs these values to be computed.

For Codellama-13b, 100% of the suggested code is executable, 83% of the strategies pro- duced coherent values, and 100% of the strategies used the declared parameters. For Codellama-70b, these numbers fall to 83% executable code, 67% of strategies give rolling numbers and 83% do include the parameters declared in their functions. Same results are observed for Mixtral-8x7b. For Mistral-7b, 100% of the proposed code is executable. However, only 50% of these strate- gies are executable and lead to rolling numbers that can be evaluated against the baseline computation. However, Llama2 and Codellama-7b exhibit the lowest percentage of executable codes that yield coherent result values. Executable code does not necessarily equate to desirable outcomes. The subsequent section will explore how Codellama-70b, despite only achieving a 67% rate of executable code that yields coherent values, exhibits commendable performance across diverse strategies. This is in contrast to Mixtral-8X7b, which, while displaying comparable rates of executable code, differs in effectiveness. In the subsequent phase of our analysis, we will assess the concordance between the outcomes generated by the executable code and the baseline computations. The Table 2 displays the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) evaluation results for six trading strategies, with certain strategies yielding multiple indicators. In three of the eight strategies Table 2: Evaluation of RMSE for Eight Trading Strategies, Including Main and Intermediate Indicators, Across Various LLMs. assessed, GPT-4-Turbo yields values that precisely match those of the baseline computations. Furthermore, Gemini-Pro and Codellama-70b also produce exact matches in some strategies, while exhibiting minimal errors in others. In the Table 3 , GPT-4-Turbo demonstrates the lowest RMSE in five of the eight strategies evaluated, and in two others, it presents the second lowest RMSE. Codellama-70b ranks as the second most performant model, delivering the best results in three out of eight indicators. Additionally, Gemini-Pro achieves the second-best performance in four out of the eight instances. 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4752797Table 3: Evaluation of RMSE: Number of time an LLM is ranked N \u00b01 or N \u00b02.N\u00b01: Meaning the LLM has the lowest RMSE. N \u00b02: Meaning the LLM has the second lowest RMSE. Overall, GPT-4-Turbo, Codellama-70B and Gemini-pro demonstrate promising out- comes when compared to baseline computations. 8 Deep Analysis and Illustrations In this section, an illustration will be provided of one of the strategies assessed across various LLMs. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) algorithm is calculated by taking the difference between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) over different time periods, typically referred to as the \u2019slow\u2019 and \u2019fast\u2019 periods.\u201d Then, a signal line is calculated from the MACD as an exponential moving average over a shorter period. There is also a third component, known as the histogram or divergence, which represents the difference between the MACD line and the Signal line. Depending on the LLM, the output may include just the MACD, both the MACD and Sig- nal Line, or all three components: MACD, Signal Line, and MACD Histogram. Here is Gemini-pro MACD implementation which provides the 3 indicators: 1 def get_macd(close, period_fast=12, period_slow=26, period_signal=9): 2 macd_exponential_fast = close.ewm(span=period_fast, adjust=False).mean() 3 macd_exponential_slow = close.ewm(span=period_slow, adjust=False).mean() 4 macd = macd_exponential_fast - macd_exponential_slow 5 macd_signal = macd.ewm(span=period_signal, adjust=False).mean() 6 macd_divergence = macd - macd_signal 7 return macd, macd_signal, macd_divergence In the Appendix I , you find Llama2-7b implementation, generating one indicator. In Figure 1, a clear representation of the strategy computation across different models is illustrated: \u2022Baseline and Codellama-70B are having almost the same results. One can see small differences at the beginning. \u2022GPT4, gemini-pro are having the exact same results. They differ from the baseline values in the instantiation of the calculation. We will see hereafter why there is this difference. However, they converge after some time ( 1.5 month) to the same exact value as the baseline calculation. In Figure 2, Mixtral-8x7b produces the same results than Gemini-pro and GPT-4-Turbo: As shown in the Table 2 , Llama2-70b is showing one of the largest error for MACD.",

By employing a detailed prompt structure that caters to the unique attributes of each LLM, we have been able to guide these models in generating executable and accurate Python code for a wide array of technical indicators crucial to the financial trading sector. Our methodology, which combines templated responses, zero-shot task-specific prompts, and prompt chaining, has proven effective in enhancing the LLMs\u2019 understanding of the tasks at hand. This approach allowed for the nuanced adaptation of prompts to match the distinct processing styles of different LLMs, thereby optimizing their performance. The evaluation framework, grounded in a comparison against baseline results from estab- lished libraries such as TALib and a comprehensive Python implementation of the indicators, has enabled us to measure the efficacy of the LLMs accurately. Our findings suggest that models like GPT-4-Turbo, Codellama-70B, and Gemini-Pro exhibit promising capabilities, with GPT-4-Turbo achieving identical implementations to the baseline in certain cases. 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4752797This study not only underscores the potential of LLMs in automating and enhancing the development of algorithmic trading strategies but also highlights the importance of structured prompt design in unlocking the full capabilities of these models. The encouraging results obtained from GPT-4-Turbo, Codellama-70B, and Gemini-Pro indicate a forward path in the application of LLMs within the domain of financial trading, suggesting that with further refinement and adaptation, these models could become indispensable tools for financial analysts and traders alike.

Abstract In this paper we use the tools and frameworks from Oxford University\u2019s postgraduate diploma in financial strategy to study the performance and benefits of algorithmic trading strategies (algos), and specifically those that use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). We discover using valuation theory from (SBS2, 2020) that algos generate superior returns compared to human discretionary trading both in normal market conditions and during large market drawdowns, such as during the coronavirus (Covid19) pandemic. Furthermore applying financial strategy techniques from (SBS1, 2020) we find that algos could be This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

Finally considering M&A growth strategies from (SBS4, 2020) we conclude that for RUS algorithmic trading capabilities would be best acquired taking an organic approach as an in- house build approach would be both cost-effective and allow for a more customized and bespoke integration. Even if only a fraction of the potential benefits are monetized, algo trading could have a significant positive impact on earnings, which in turn would allow for reinvestment to facilitate sustainable growth and maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. 1. Introduction The current Covid19 pandemic required that the financial services industry invest heavily in technology and cyber security in order to facilitate remote working, whilst adhering to strict regulation controls to keep businesses and data secure. Opportunistic and prudent investment firms could leverage such technology investments to invest in high growth opportunities and increase their algorithmic trading capabilities. In times of crisis trading systems using artificial intelligence & machine learning have the potential to provide a competitive advantage as they constantly adapt to market conditions (JP Morgan, 2019). They have the ability to process vast amounts of traditional, social media and alternative reference data at high speed to gauge market sentiment. Moreover, they 1 See appendix for full case study details This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3816567Preprint not peer reviewed 2 can manage more highly diversified portfolios to reduce idiosyncratic risk and increase Sharpe ratios2 (Esposito, 2020) , (Institutional Investor, 2020) . In this paper we study if algorithmic trading strategies generate superior returns, if they could provide a sustainable competitive advantage relative to discretionary (or human) trading and we consider how to best acquire and integrate algo capabilities at RUS. We proceed as follows: firstly we give an overview of the current market environment. Secondly we introduce algorithmic trading and outline the main machine learning techniques and how they can be used. Thirdly we compare the performance of algos and discretionary trading systems using a hedge fund case study, where we classify funds by their investment strategy. Fourthly we investigate if algos could provide a sustainable competitive advantage and fifthly we consider how my organization RUS should acquire and integrate algo capabilities with existing skills and resources. 2. Current Environment The ongoing coronavirus (Covid19) global pandemic (2019-2021) has caused widespread distress, disruption and as of January 2021 has claimed the lives of more than 2.2 million people, (WHO, 2021) . The attempts of Governments to control the virus through lockdowns and curfews have harmed economies and businesses, particularly those in the hospitality, travel and tourism sectors. Digital organisations, technology stocks and the FANGs3 have 2 Sharpe ratios measure performance as the return of an investment per unit risk. 3 The FANGs are the four prominent tech stocks in the U.S. namely Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (previously Google). The equivalents in China are the BAT stocks Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.",

Despite the development of new vaccines to counter the pandemic, many are still wondering what a recovery could look like and businesses need to consider the possibility of tail risks such as coronavirus mutation and further pandemics. The new normal way of life relies on technology, with day to day business being conducted online using technologies, such as Skype, Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Consequently to survive many businesses had no choice but to invest in technology & infrastructure to facilitate the high demand for online working and manage the associated cyber security risks. To more formally assess the current macro environment and highlight opportunities and threats relevant to the financial services industry we perform a PESTEL analysis (Whittington et al, 2020) . The analysis is categorised into six environmental factors, namely Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Ecological and Legal and is often used to aid macro forecasts and scenario analyses. In (figure 2.1) we build upon and extend the PESTEL analysis from (Burgess, 2020b) to incorporate the most recent Covid19 impact assessments on the broad macro environment see (McKinsey, n.d.) and (McKinsey, 2021) . This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3816567Preprint not peer reviewed 4 Figure 2.1 PESTEL Analysis for Financial Services Source: Macro Scenario Analysis of Financial Services (Burgess, 2020b) Key highlights stem from the broad economic impact of the Covid19 pandemic, which has required quantitative easing and government stimuli to counter the effect of mandatory lockdowns, workforce disruption and business closures. In the U.S. alone, the economy is estimated to incur net GDP losses ranging from $3.2 trillion (14.8%) to $4.8 trillion (23.0%) over a 2-year period. (Walmsley et al, 2020) . Furthermore investment in new technologies facilitates a mobile, flexible workforce and enables remote working to keep businesses open, but also presents opportunities to exploit competitor weakness and capture market share due to the different levels of business readiness and technological capacity in the industry. Prudent and opportunistic investment firms could invest in technologies with a high growth potential, such as algorithmic trading, to gain a sustainable competitive advantage.

As outlined in (Burgess 2019a) , algorithmic trading (or systematic trading) refers to the automation of the trading process, through the creation of predefined rules (the \u2018trading system\u2019) and their strict application when executing financial market transactions. The automated trading system benefits from being repeatable and testable, unlike discretionary trading (or human trading), which potentially has different rules for every transaction. Algorithmic trading systems are predominantly employed by Hedge Funds to create leveraged alternative investment portfolios uncorrelated with the market. Currently the world\u2019s hedge funds have USD 3.1 trillion assets under management (Statista1, n.d.) . Similarly algos are used by high frequency trading firms (HFTs) to make markets, seek liquidity rebates and exploit market inefficiencies to benefit from arbitrage opportunities (Brogaard et al, 2011) .

Many trading strategies were trained to follow predefined trading signals that were not able adapt to the new market environment. Consequently human-run hedge funds trounced Quant funds (Bloomberg, 2020) . For example in equity markets discretionary funds beat systemic funds during the Covid19 market shock and performed much better than Quants models and systematic investing (Factor Research, 2020) . Figure 3.3: Equity Market Neutral (EMN) Hedge Funds - Discretionary vs Systematic Investing Source: Factor Research However artificial intelligence funds vastly outperformed discretionary funds with their trading strategies having the ability to continually process, learn and adapt to new market conditions. Reports such as (Institutional Investor, 2020) and (Robinson, 2020) claimed that AI funds generated returns almost three-times higher than that of other hedge funds. Both (Friedman, 2019) and (Eurekahedge, 2018) also confirm that AI and machine learning funds generated superior returns as shown in (figure 3.4) and (figure 3.5) below.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3816567Preprint not peer reviewed 9 Consequently, from here onwards we focus on algorithmic trading systems that use artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive technologies to make investment decisions as we look to answer the headline question and investigate if algorithmic trading generated superior returns relative to discretionary trading during the Covid19 pandemic and if they could provide a sustainable competitive advantage. Machine learning funds try to incorporate and adapt to live market data and current sentiment as much as possible. They go far beyond traditional back-testing approaches and the use of fundamental and technical analysis to generate alpha. They look for patterns in current market micro-structure4 and gauge current market sentiment, using behavioural science, neuro-linguistic programming, natural language processing (NLP) and deep data techniques to interpret and process enormous volumes of text, speech and sentiment from social media, news channels and alternative reference data in real time, see (L\u03ccpez de Prado, 2018) and (Wyman, 2014) . The processing of vast amounts of data in real time is an impossible task for human traders. Consequently discretionary traders are forced to concentrate their efforts on a handful of securities compared to the machine learning funds that are able diversify far more broadly. Algorithmic trading strategies characteristically hold a large number of securities to take advantage of the law of large numbers and statistical edges. This diversification reduces idiosyncratic risk, a risk that the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) says can be diversified away and consequently investors are not rewarded for, see (Berk and DeMarzo, 2016) , (Brealey et al, 2014) and (Burgess, 2021) . As a result machine learning portfolios have the 4 A simple example being the cancellation of many sell orders might indicate an imminent uptick or rally.

Kth Nearest Neighbours (KNN) \u2013 Supervised Learning We start out with N data points that are already classified into groups or features. New data is classified as being in the most popular group as determined by the Kth nearest data points. For example, given a list of trading features that constitute a buy, sell or hold signal, what does the current market features suggest we should do? 2. K Means Clustering (KMC) \u2013 Unsupervised Learning Given unclassified data points represented by feature vectors5 we gather them into K groups associated with their centres of mass or centroids. This is useful for measuring financial data that clusters or is mean reverting , such as interest rate or volatility levels. 5 Each data point is represented as a list of features describing the data, commonly referred to as a feature vector This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) \u2013 Supervised Learning Given a set of classified data represented by vectors of features, we divide the data using a hyperplane and classify new data according to which side of the hyperplane each data point lies. This is useful for detecting when trading levels are rich or cheap. 5. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) \u2013 Unsupervised Learning We start with all our data points represented as feature vectors. We then map similar data and features into a two-dimensional grid to visualize which data have similar characteristics. This is useful for hedging and identifying stocks for pairs trading. It is also useful in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) whereby stocks can be grouped into buy and sell categories based on expected returns, volatility and correlations between stocks.

Trading strategies using supervised techniques often use historical data for pre- classification, however past performance is no guarantee of future results. Unsupervised learning approaches rely less on historical trends and seek to constantly learn and adapt to new market environments. Consequently they require large representative data sets to be effective, eliminate bias and error (Lynch 2018) . Unsupervised strategies are perhaps well placed to manage market shocks such as those faced during the Covid19 pandemic. However it is a balancing act as fund managers don\u2019t want trading systems to react too quickly to noise in the market information nor so slowly that they miss a trend. Perhaps this suggests that some human oversight may be helpful. In summary algorithmic or systemic trading is simply the automation of the trading process, which could involve full or partial automation of the trading system including trading signal classification, trade execution, hedging and the risk management process. In theory such trading systems are ideal to monitor, adapt and respond to new market conditions not seen before, such as those experienced during the Covid19 pandemic, but how did they perform in practice?

Algorithmic Trading Performance In this section we study at algorithmic trading performance during normal market conditions and market shocks such as that during the Covid19 pandemic (figure 3.2) . We perform a case study analysis comparing artificial intelligence tech fund performance with that of quant and discretionary funds. We ask the reader to note that when evaluating and comparing fund performance there are many factors to consider including investment manager skill and ability, fund size, market sectors invested in, currency, inflation factors et al, hence relative performance does not reflect on causality. Relative performance is purely suggestive and used to highlight the potential for algorithmic trading and predictive technologies to provide a competitive advantage. 4.1 Measuring Hedge Fund Performance When comparing hedge fund performance it is not sufficient to only consider fund returns, as investors can increase returns by leveraging positions and taking more risk. Consequently fund performance is measured using risk-adjusted returns i.e. return per unit risk, which gives a convenient uniform performance measure that can be applied to all funds. No trading strategy or fund can be profitable at all times and during all market conditions, consequently investors pay close attention to fund drawdowns, both the size and frequency of losses suffered by the fund. There are several measures of fund performance (Steinki and Mohammad, 2015) , each with different pros and cons. The main measure used is the Sharpe Ratio defined in (formula 4.1). Other measures include the Sortino Ratio that only measures downside risk (negative variations) and the Treynor Ratio which measures risk as CAPM Beta (Burgess, 2021) .

Example 4.1 Sharpe Ratio Consider two investment funds A and B having an average annual return 12% with incremental drawdowns of 5% and 10% respectively. Clearly fund A performs best as it bears less risk for the same return. If it is known the risk free rate is 2% for our investment horizon then using (formula 4.1) we have Sharpe Ratio (fund A) = (12% - 2%) / 5% = 2.0 and Sharpe Ratio (fund B) = (12% - 2%) / 10% = 1.0. A fund\u2019s performance is not only due to its ability to generate superior returns, but also its ability to minimize risk and limit the size and frequency of its drawdowns. Consequently we review fund performance not just in normal market conditions but also during the Covid19 market shock, as illustrated in (figure 3.2) when many funds were experiencing large drawdowns.",

We present a summary of results above in in (table 4.2) . 4.3 Algorithmic Trading Performance during Covid19 Drawdown (March-April 2020) Hedge fund performance during market drawdowns is very important. It highlights the skill of the fund manager to avoid large losses and manage downside risk. Summarizing the results presented in (table 4.2) we see that during the Covid19 market drawdown in March- April 2020 (figure 3.2) AI funds performed well and made gains of +3.27% whereas traditional discretionary funds reported losses of -2.23% over the same period. AI funds had the lowest downside volatility of 2.25% and amongst all the hedge fund groups had one of the smallest maximum drawdowns, which for AI funds was -7.24% compared to -6.30% & -14.42% for quant funds and -12.27% for discretionary funds. Morningstar Direct data reported that during the Covid19 pandemic AI technology funds held up relatively well, reporting that in April 2020 as the FTSE 100 and S&P 500 plunged more than -20% and tech funds were down as little as -4.6% (Esposito, 2020) . Bloomberg also showed that the downside volatility of AI funds during the Covid19 major market downturn was exceptionally small (figure 4.3) . This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

This highlights the fund manager\u2019s ability to profit in normal market conditions and more specifically in this period to also benefit from and exploit post Covid19 opportunities. Reviewing the results presented in (table 4.2) from a post Covid19 perspective we see that algorithmic trading using artificial intelligence earned returns of +11.24% beating quant funds with returns of +7.85% and +10.92% and almost matching traditional discretionary This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

Competitive Advantage As outlined in (Burgess, 2020c) the long-term survival of any organisation relies upon its ability to well-manage resources to create dynamic capabilities valued by customers. Threshold capabilities are required to survive in a given market and achieve competitive parity. However dynamic capabilities utilise the entire value chain (Zenger, 2013) . They are sets of resources, capabilities, skills and abilities (figure 5.1) , which together combine to form core competencies that can respond dynamically to environmental opportunities and threats. They have the potential to create a sustainable competitive advantage.

Furthermore using a competitor SWOT analysis (figure 5.3) to contrast RUS\u2019s core competencies against key competitors reveals that RUS are only able to achieve competitive parity.

We performed a VRINO analysis, in (Burgess, 2020c) , based on RUS\u2019s current capabilities and value chain. In this paper we look extend this analysis to examine if investing in algorithmic trading capabilities9 and combining this with the existing \u201cagile pricing and risk analytics\u201d (Burgess, 2020c) could create a new core competency \u201c Advanced Automation of Pricing, Risk and Execution \u201d that could offer superior trading and risk management capabilities and give RUS a sustainable competitive advantage. The VRINO analysis is performed below. 5.1 VRINO Analysis - Valuable The new core competency would facilitate sophisticated state-of-art trade execution and orders could be worked systematically to reduce market frictions to achieve the best price. This is valuable to customers as it would facilitate better transaction prices and reduce human error. It is valuable to RUS as it would also reduce human resource costs, which are the biggest costs the organization incur. It would also reduce operational costs, create economies of scale, improve cross-selling opportunities and would enable RUS to outperform 8 VRINO is an acronym for Valuable, Rate, Inimitable, Non-substitutable and Organisationally Appropriable, sometimes also referred to as VRIO without the Non-substitutable element. 9 In this paper we are specifically referring to algorithmic trading systems that use artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive technologies.

There is a strong possibility algorithmic trading plays a key role in generating superior returns. As demonstrated by hedge fund managers using artificial intelligence, who have better managed market drawdowns and outperformed other funds on a risk-adjusted basis as indicated by their higher Sharpe ratios (figure 4.5) . 5.2 VRINO Analysis - Rare We performed a strategy canvas analysis to produce a value curve for RUS and its competitors (figure 5.4) . A value curve measures perceived performance against critical success factors (CSFs). It can be a subjective process and difficult for managers to agree on which critical success factors to prioritise as highlighted by (Kim and Mauborgne, 2002) . The analysis highlighted that algorithmic trading capabilities, digital services and technology innovation are rare skills that could exploit competitor weakness.

Downside challenges would likely arise from having to work with expensive legacy infrastructure, outdated IT policies and poor IT management. Manager skill is critical for success to navigate IT challenges and if managed well this approach could be a cost effective solution. Following (Ansoff, 1957) we recommend the integration plan illustrated in (figure 6.2) .

Market Penetration First consolidate core business lines and focus on market penetration and growing core rates trading and fixed income businesses, which are well-established yet have more potential. 2. Product & Services Diversification Second diversify by product and asset class to provide advanced services and support for credit derivatives, foreign exchange, interest rate swaptions, convertible bonds and equity businesses. 3. Market Diversification Thirdly diversify by market, starting with the most similar business entities, namely RUS Bank London, RUS Securities New York, Hong Kong then Tokyo (in this order). A cautious more arm\u2019s length approach should be taken with overseas branches, where cultural CAGE11 distances (Ghemawat and Altman, 2019) can lead to lengthy P&L12, cost, ownership and other internal disputes that often destroy rather than create value. When integrating algo capabilities, RUS should focus on enhancing core business performance and limited related diversification. Research shows (Whittington et al, 2020) that it is important to diversify, but not over-diversify, as unrelated diversification is ineffective and often lowers performance, as illustrated in (figure 6.3) . 11 CAGE distances track cultural, administrative, geographical and economic differences. 12 P&L is an acronym for profit and loss.

This is often referred to as a Quantamental15 approach (L\u03ccpez de Prado, 2018) , where we combine quantitative approaches using high-end computers, mathematical models and big data with fundamental methods where humans manually analyse investment opportunities to generate better risk- adjusted returns (Lynch, 2018) , (Smigel, n.d.) . Moreover, as automation frees human resource, human effort should be reassigned to high value-add work items.

Conclusion We have learned that algorithmic trading strategies generated superior returns relative to discretionary trading during the Covid19 pandemic and that they facilitate better management of major market drawdowns. We also showed that both during normal market conditions and times of crisis they generate superior risk-adjusted returns and exhibit higher Sharpe ratios.

It would complement RUS\u2019s existing value chain to create a new core competency \u201cAdvanced Automation of Pricing, Risk and Execution\u201d services, which would give RUS a sustainable competitive advantage . These are unprecedented times for the world and financial markets; the economic outlook is uncertain yet cautiously optimistic.

The first characteristic that this system must possess is that of having a very low ratio between the deterministic component and the random component. Therefore, the random component must overcome the deterministic component. The second characteristic that we need to determine concerns the number of degrees of freedom. This parameter determines how much difficult it is to test hypotheses. This consideration derives from the fundamental problem of statistics defined as follows: \"A statistical data does not represent useful information, but becomes useful information only when it is shown that it was not obtained randomly\" . Therefore, given a result, the probability of o btaining it randomly decreases as the degrees of freedom of the system increase. Consequently, systems with a low number of degrees of freedom are particularly dangerous, because it is particularly easy to get good results randomly and therefore you risk o verestimating an investment strategy. For this reason, a system that wants to be as difficult as possible where making predictions must have a low number of degrees of freedom. The third characteristic we have to choose is if to consider the system as erg odic (stationary) or non-ergodic (non -stationary). This choice is easy because it is much more difficult to make forecasts on a non -ergodic system. Indeed, in this case, past results may not be significant with respect to future results. In conclusion, th e system that represents, from the theoretical point of view, the most difficult situation in which to make predictions is a system in which there is a predominant random component, with a low number of degrees of freedom and not ergodic. Is there a system that has all these 3 characteristics? The answer is yes indeed, the financial markets represent a system that respects all these conditions. I started this book with this consideration because I believe that the most important thing to understand, for any person who wants to develop a quantitative trading system, is to know that you are facing the most difficult situation theoretically possible where to make predictions. It is this awareness that must guide us in the study of the financial markets. Without this awareness, we will inevitably be led to underestimate the difficulty of the problem and this will lead us to make mistakes.

The order of the articles was chosen so as to constitute a single logical reasoning that develops progressively. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=39947646 Statistics Financial markets are characterized by a dominant random component with respect to the deterministic component. For this reason, the articles present are intended to explain the statistical analysis under these conditions. The main topic that is treated c oncerns the definition of the uncertainty of the statistical data. The traditional approach considers uncertainty as the dispersion of data around the true value. Therefore, it is based on the hypothesis that any divergence from uniformity is the result of a deterministic component. This condition is realistic only in systems where the random component is negligible. Instead, in cases, such as in finance, where the random component prevails, it turns out to be an unrealistic hypothesis that leads to incorre ct conclusions. For this reason, we will give a new definition of uncertainty suitable for a system in which there is a predominant random component. The parameter that has been chosen for its definition is represented by the probability of obtaining an eq ual or better result in a random way. Knowing how to calculate this parameter correctly represents the basis of statistics in finance. As I will show in the articles, this calculation is very difficult, and extremely easy to underestimate the uncertainty. Indeed, the mistake made is to evaluate the individual hypotheses independently without considering the hypotheses previously tested. This way of operating often leads, in systems with a low number of degrees of freedom where it is easy to obtain good resu lts randomly, to underestimating uncertainty. This approach will then be applied in different situations, such as in the case of the resolution of the St. Petersburg paradox. In this way, we will have concrete examples of how this method represents a comp letely new point of view in the evaluation of hypotheses. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=39947647 The uncertainty of the statistical data Andrea Berdondini ABSTRACT: Any result can be generated randomly and any random result is useless. Traditional methods define uncertainty as a measure of the dispersion around the true value and are based on the hypothesis that any divergence from uniformity is the result o f a deterministic event. The problem with this approach is that even non -uniform distributions can be generated randomly and the probability of this event rises as the number of hypotheses tested increases. Consequently, there is a risk of considering a ra ndom and therefore non-repeatable hypothesis as deterministic. Indeed, it is believed that this way of acting is the cause of the high number of non -reproducible results. Therefore, we believe that the probability of obtaining an equal or better result ran domly is the true uncertainty of the statistical data. Because it represents the probability that the data is useful and therefore the validity of any other analysis depends on this parameter. Introduction Any result can be generated randomly and any random result is useless. Traditional methods [1] and [2] define uncertainty as a measure of the dispersion around the true value and are based on the hypothesis that any divergence from uniformity is the result of a deterministic event. The problem with this approach is that even non -uniform distributions can be generated randomly and the probability of this event rises as the number of hypotheses tested increases. Consequently, there is a risk of considering a random and therefore non -repeatable hypothesis as deterministic. Indeed, it is believed that this way of acting is the cause of the high number of non -reproducible results [3] and [4]. Therefore, we believe that the probability of obtaining an equal or bet ter result randomly is the true uncertainty of the statistical data, because it represents the probability that the data is useful and therefore the validity of any other analysis depends on this parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of determining the correct method of calculating the probability of obtaining an equal or better result randomly.",

        "content": "Regarding this topic, we will see that the fundamental point, in calculating this probability value, is to consider the statistical data depende nt on all the other data generated by all the tested hypotheses. Considering the statistical data as non -independent has fundamental implications in statistical analysis. Indeed, all our random actions are not only useless, but will increase the uncertaint y of the statistical data. For this reason, in the following article [5], we highlight the importance of acting consciously in statistics. Furthermore, the evaluation of the uncertainty of the statistical data will be possible only by knowing all the attem pts made. In practice, the calculation of uncertainty is very difficult because not only we must consider all our attempts, but we must also consider the attempts made by every other person who is performing the same task as us. In this way, the uncertaint y of our statistical data also depends on the actions performed by the people who are working our own analysis. Indeed, a group of people who belong to a research network all having the same reputation who all work on the same problem can be considered wit h one person who carries out all the attempts made. Consequently, the calculation of uncertainty becomes something relative that depends on the information we have. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=39947648 Definition of uncertainty The aim of the definition of uncertainty of the statistical data that we are going to give is to determine a parameter that is linked to the repeatability of the result and that is universal and therefore, independent of the system in which we perform the statistical analysis. We define the uncertainty of the stati stical data as the probability of obtaining an equal or better result randomly. This definition considers the statistical data as a forecast, so a forecast is repeatable only if the process that generated it is non -random. Consequently, the calculation of uncertainty involves determining the type of process that generated the result. We can distinguish cognitive processes from random processes by their statistical property of generating non -reproducible results in a random way. Indeed, by using the informat ion on the system, on which we are performing a measurement, we can increase our probability of forecasting and this leads to a consequent decrease in the probability of obtaining the same result randomly. It is interesting to note that the repeatability of the statistical data and non -randomness of the process that produced it are two equivalent concepts. Indeed, the information leads to the repeatability of the result and at the same time generates results that cannot be reproduced randomly. To understa nd the definition given, we report the following example: We have to analyze a statistical datum represented by 1000 predictions on an event that can have only two results. The 1000 predictions are divided into 600 successes and 400 failures. To calculate the probability of obtaining an equal or better result in a random way, we use the binomial distribution and we obtain the following value 1.4\u221910\u22128%. Now, instead, let us consider a statistical datum represented by 10 predictions divided into 8 successes a nd 2 failures. In this case, the probability of getting an equal or better result randomly is 5.5%. Comparing the two results, we note that in the first case, although the number of successes is only 60%, the uncertainty is almost zero, while in the second case, with a probability of success of 80%, the uncertainty is much higher. This difference is due to the fact that the definition given, as mentioned, concerns only the repeatability of the result and not its accuracy. Therefore, it is a value that decre ases as the repetition of the result increases. The approach presented is very different from the classic approach, where uncertainty is seen as a measure of the dispersion of the data with respect to the true value. The fundamental point to understand is that the probability that statistical data is completely random and the estimate of its random component (dispersion around the true value) are two parameters that are only partially dependent on each other.",

        "content": "The first decreases as the number of repetitions of the measurement increases, the second does not and this is one of the reasons, why the traditional definition of uncertainty, in many cases, is not significant with regard to the repeatability of the result. The problem, as we have seen in the examples , is that there is always a greater or lesser probability that a purely random process generates the result. In this case, any analysis turns out to be wrong, for this reason, this value is considered the true uncertainty of the statistical result. Calcul ation of the uncertainty of the statistical data Correctly calculating the probability of getting an equal or better result randomly involves changing our approach to statistics. The approach commonly used in statistics is to consider the data produced Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=39947649 by one method independent of the data produced by different methods. This way of proceeding seems the only possible one but, as we will show in the following paradox, it leads to an illogical result, which is instead solved by considering the data as non -independent. We think to have a computer with enormous computational capacity that is used to develop hypotheses about a phenomenon that we want to study. The computer works as follows: it creates a random hypothesis and then performs a statistical test. At this point, we ask ourselves the following question: can there be a useful statistical test to evaluate the results of the hypothesis generated? If we answer yes, we get an illogical result because our computer would always be able, by generating a large number of random hypotheses, to find a hypothesis that passes the statistical test. In this way, we arrive at the absurd conclusion that it is possible to create knowledge randomly, because it is enough to have a very powerful computer and a statistical te st to understand every phenomenon. If we answer no, we get another illogical result because we are saying that no hypothesis can be evaluated. In practice, the results of different hypotheses are all equivalent and indistinguishable. How can we solve this logical paradox? The only way to answer the question, without obtaining an illogical situation, is to consider the results obtained from different methods depending on each other. A function that meets this condition is the probability of getting an equal or better result at random. Indeed, the calculation of this probability implies the random simulation of all the actions performed. Hence, random attempts increase the number of actions performed and consequently increase the probability of obtaining an eq ual or better result randomly. For this reason, generating random hypotheses is useless, and therefore if you use this parameter, as a measure of uncertainty, it is possible to evaluate the data and at the same time it is impossible to create knowledge by generating random hypotheses. Considering the statistical data as non -independent is a fundamental condition for correctly calculating the uncertainty. The probability of getting an equal or better result at random meets this condition. The dependence of statistical data on each other has profound implications in statistics, which will be discussed in the next section. Consequences of the non -independence of the statistical data Considering the statistical data dependent on each other in the calculation of uncertainty leads to three fundamental consequences in statistics. First fundamental consequence of the non -independence of the statistical data: our every random action always involves an increase in the uncertainty of the statistical data. Example: We need to analyze a statistical datum represented by 10 predictions about an event that can only have two results. The 10 predictions are divided into 8 successes and 2 failures. To calculate the probability of obtaining an equal or better resul t randomly we use the binomial distribution and we get the following value 5.5%. If before making these 10 predictions, we tested a different hypothesis with which we made 10 other predictions divided into 5 successes and 5 failures, the uncertainty of our result changes.",

        "content": "Indeed, in this case, we must calculate the probability of obtaining a result with a number of successes greater than or equal to 8 by performing two random attempts consisting of 10 predictions each. In this case, the probability becomes 10.6%, so the fact of having first tested a random hypothesis almost doubled the uncertainty of our second hypothesis. Consequently, increasing the random hypotheses increases the number of predictions that we will have to make, with the true hypothesis, t o have an acceptable uncertainty. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476410 Second fundamental consequence of the non -independence of the statistical data: every random action of ours and of every other person equivalent to us, always involves an increase in the uncertainty of the statistical dat a. By the equivalent term, we mean a person with the same reputation as us, therefore the data produced by equivalent people are judged with the same weight. Example: 10 people participate in a project whose goal is the development of an algorithm capable of predicting the outcome of an event that can have only two results. An external person who does not participate in the project but is aware of every attempt made by the participants evaluates the statistical data obtained. All participants make 100 predi ctions, 9 get a 50% chance of success, one gets a 65% chance of success. The uncertainty of the static data of the participant who obtains a probability of success of 65% is obtained by calculating the probability of obtaining a result with a number of suc cesses greater than or equal to 65 by performing ten random attempts consisting of 100 predictions each. The probability obtained, in this way, is 16% instead if he was the only participant in the project the probability would have been 0.18%, therefore ab out 100 times lower. Third fundamental consequence of the non -independence of the statistical data: the calculation of the uncertainty varies according to the information possessed. Example: 10 people participate in a project whose goal is the development of an algorithm capable of predicting the outcome of an event that can have only two results. In this case, people do not know the other participants and think they are the only ones participating in the project. All participants make 100 predictions, 9 g et a 50% chance of success and one gets a 65% chance of success. The participant who obtains a probability of success of 65% independently calculates the uncertainty of the result obtained. Not knowing that other people are participating in the project, ca lculate the probability of obtaining a result with a number of successes greater than or equal to 65 by performing a single random attempt consisting of 100 predictions; the probability obtained is 0.18%. An external person who is aware of every attempt ma de by the participants calculates the uncertainty of the participant's statistical data, which obtains a probability of success of 65%. It then calculates the probability of obtaining a result with a number of successes greater than or equal to 65 by makin g ten random attempts consisting of 100 predictions each. The probability obtained, in this way, is 16%, a much higher value than the uncertainty calculated by the participant. The uncertainty value calculated by the external person using more information is most accurate than the uncertainty value calculated by the individual participant. Consequently, the uncertainty value obtained by exploiting the greatest number of information must always be considered, in the case of the example, the most accurate uncertainty is that of 16%. The first and second fundamental highlighting consequence of the non -independence of the statistical data can be redefined by highlighting the non -randomness of the action. First fundamental consequence of the non -independence of the statistical data: our every non - random action always involves a decrease in the uncertainty of the statistical data. Second fundamental consequence of the non -independence of the statistical data: every non -random action of ours and of every other per son equivalent to us, always involves a decrease in the uncertainty of the statistical data.",

        "content": "Conclusion The traditional definition of uncertainty implies considering true, for non -homogeneous data dispersions, the hypothesis that the result is not comp letely random. We consider this assumption the main problem of the definition of uncertainty. Indeed, whatever the statistical data obtained, there is Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476411 always a possibility that they are completely random and therefore useless. This error stems from the fact that the definition of uncertainty was developed in an environment where each method had a strong deterministic component. Therefore, calculating the probability of obtaining an equal or better result at random might seem useless. However, when we app ly statistics in fields such as finance, where the random component is predominant the traditional approach to uncertainty turns out to be unsuccessful. It fails for the simple reason that the hypothesis on which it is based may not be true. For this reaso n, we have defined the uncertainty of the statistical data as the probability of obtaining an equal or better result randomly. Since this definition of uncertainty is not linked to any hypothesis, it turns out to be universal. The correct calculation of th is probability value implies considering the statistical data dependent on each other. This assumption, as we have shown through a paradox, makes the definition of uncertainty given consistent with the logical principle that it is not possible to create kn owledge randomly. The non -independence of the statistical data implies that each action performed has an effect on the calculation of uncertainty. The interesting aspect is that a dependence is also created between actions performed by different people. C onsequently, the calculation of uncertainty depends on the information in our possession, so it becomes something relative that can be determined absolutely only with complete knowledge of the information.

In practice, the probability of obtaining the same result randomly must be very low in order to consider the result useful. It follows th at the value of a statistical datum is something absolute, but its evaluation in order to understand whether it is useful or not is something relative depending on the actions that have been performed. Consequently, a situation such as the one described in this paradox can occur, wherein in one case it is practically certain that the statistical datum is useful, instead of in the other case the statistical datum turns out to be completely devoid of value. This paradox wants to bring attention to the importa nce of the procedure used to extract statistical information. Indeed, the way in which we act affects the probability of obtaining the same result in a random way and consequently on the evaluation of the statistical parameter . The information paradox We have two identical universes, in both universes the same person is present, that we will call John, he must perform the exact same task which is to analyze a database in order to extract useful correlations. As we have said the universes are equal, so the databases are identical and the person who has to do the work is the same. The database that needs to be analyzed consists of a million parameters related to an event to be studied.",

From this analysis he finds 50 parameters with a high correlation with the event, the correlation found has a chance to happen randomly of 0.005%. Of these 50 parameters, John id entifies 10 that according to his experience can be useful in order to study the event. However it is important to point out that the assumptions made by John, on the 10 parameters, are only hypotheses based on his experience, they are not scientific demon strations that explain precisely the correlation of the 10 parameters with the event. In the universe \"2\", John acts in the following way: before analyzing the entire database he uses his knowledge of the event in order to select 10 parameters, that he be lieves are most correlated with the event, from the million parameters available. However, also in this case, it is important to point out that the assumptions made by John, on the 10 parameters, are only hypotheses based on his experience, they are not sc ientific demonstrations that explain precisely the correlation of the 10 parameters with the event. Analyzing only these 10 parameters, he finds 5 of them with a high correlation with the event, the correlation found has a chance to happen randomly of 0.00 5% (as in the previous case). In practice, the fundamental difference in the analysis method that John does in the two universes is that: in the first universe John uses his own experience after performing statistical analysis on the whole database, inste ad in the second universe, John uses his experience before to perform the statistical analysis in order to reduce the size of the database. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476413 Now let us see how this different approach affects the evaluation of the data obtained. To do this, we must calcula te the probability of obtaining the same results randomly in the two cases. In the first case, universe \"1\", in order to calculate the probability of obtaining the same results in a random way we must use the binomial distribution formula with the followi ng parameters: probability of victory (p) = probability of getting the same correlation randomly number of successes (k) = number of parameters that present the correlation considered number of tests (L) = total number of parameters present in the datab ase By entering these data within the binomial distribution formula: \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc3f,\ud835\udc5d)=(\ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc58)\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc58(1\u2212\ud835\udc5d)\ud835\udc3f\u2212\ud835\udc58 p = 0.005% k = 50 L = 1 Million We get a probability of 5.6% as a result. Now let's consider the second case, the universe \"2\", even in this situation, in order to calculate the probability of obtaining the same results in a random way we must use the binomial distribution formula with the following parameters: p = 0.005% k = 5 L = 10 The probability obtained in this case is 7.9 \u221910\u221218 % . Analyzing these results it is easy to understand that a percentage of 5.6% makes the correlations found not significant. In order to understand how high this percentage is, we can also calculate the probability of obtaining, in a random way, more than 50 of parameters wi th the correlation considered, this probability is 46%. Now we analyze the percentage of the second case ( 7.9 \u221910\u221218 %) this percentage is extremely low, consequently we are practically certain that the correlation found is not random and therefore this r esult represents a useful information for studying the event. At this point, John must to decide whether to implement the correlations found or not. Obviously, exploiting the correlations found implies costs, therefore a wrong evaluation involves a high risk. In the universe \u201c1\u201d John is in a difficult situation, in f act the work done is not only useless but also dangerous because it can lead him to sustain wrong investments. Instead, in the second universe John knows that the probability that the correlation is random is almost zero, so Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476414 he can invest with an acceptabl e risk.",

        "content": "In conclusion, a simple procedural error has led to enormous consequences. In the first case the experience of john is useless, instead in the second case it was a key resource in order to extract useful information from a big database. In fact, in the case of the universe \u201c1\u201d, John can no longer use his own knowledge and the only thing he can do is transform his hypotheses into real scientific demonstrations, but in many situations, as in the financial field, doing it can be very difficult. Conse quently, when hypotheses are made after having carried out an analysis, these hypotheses risk being conditioned by the results and therefore lose value. Instead, the hypotheses made before the analysis are not conditioned and the analysis of the data is used in order to verify them in a statistical way, as happened in the universe \u201c2\u201d. One of the fields where it is fundamental to calculate the probability of obtaining the same data in a random way, as a method of evaluating the correlations detected, is the financial one [1], [2]. Conclusion In this article we have used a paradox to explain how a statistical datum does not represent a useful information, it becomes a useful information, to study an event, only when it is possible to prove that the probabi lity that it was obtained in a random way is very low. This consideration makes the application of statistics, as a method of evaluating a hypothesis, a \"relativistic\" science. In fact, as described in the paradox, the calculation of the probability of obt aining the same result in a random way is something of relative that depend from the method used and from the actions performed. These considerations have a great impact from an experimental point of view, because they teach us the importance of correct p lanning, in which we must always implement all the knowledge about the event we want to study. It is also essential keep track of all the operations performed on the data, because this information is necessary in order to calculate correctly the probabilit y of obtaining the same results in a random way. This way of interpreting statistical data is also very useful for understanding the phenomenon of overfitting, a very important issue in data analysis [3], [4]. The overfitting seen from this point of view is simply the direct consequence of considering the statistical parameters, and therefore the results obtained, as a useful information without checking that them was not obtained in a random way . Therefore, in order to estimate the presence of overfittin g we have to use the algorithm on a database equivalent to the real one but with randomly generated values, repeating this operation many times we can estimate the probability of obtaining equal or better results in a random way. If this probability is hig h, we are most likely in an overfitting situation. For example, the probability that a fourth -degree polynomial has a correlation of 1 with 5 random points on a plane is 100%, so this correlation is useless and we are in an overfitting situation. This app roach can also be applied to the St Petersburg paradox [5], in fact also in this case Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476415 the expectation gain is a statistical datum that must be evaluated before being used at the decisional level. In fact, the difficulty in solving the paradox stems from th e fact of considering a statistical datum always as a useful information. Analyzing the expectation gain it is possible to proof that we can obtain better result, randomly, with a probability that tends asymptotically to 50%. Consequently, the expectation gain that tends to infinity turns out to be a statistic data without value that cannot be used for decision -making purposes. This way of thinking gives an explanation to the logical principle of Occam's razor, in which it is advisable to choose the simple st solution among the available solutions. In fact, for example, if we want to analyze some points on a plane with a polynomial, increasing the degree increases the probability that a given correlation can occur randomly.",

Therefore, the value of the correlat ion is an absolute datum but its validity to study a set of data is something relative that depends on the method used. Consequently the simpler methods, being less parameterized, have a lower probability of a randomly correlation, so they are preferred ov er the complex methods.

Using this theory, the fundamental problem of statistics can be expressed as follows: \" A statistical data does not represent useful in formation, but becomes useful information only when it is shown that it was not obtained randomly \". Consequently, according to this point of view, among the hypotheses that perform the same prediction, we must choose the result that has a lower probability of being produced randomly. Therefore, the fundamental aspect of this approach is to calculate correctly this probability value. This problem is addressed by redefining what is meant by hypothesis. The traditional approach considers the hypothesis as the set of rules that actively participate in the forecast. Instead, we consider as hypotheses the sum of all the hypotheses made, also considering the hypotheses preceding the one used. Therefore, each time a prediction is made, our hypothesis increases in co mplexity and consequently increases its ability to adapt to a random data set. In this way, the complexity of a hypothesis can be precisely determined only if all previous attempts are known. Consequently, Occam's razor principle no longer has a general va lue, but its application depends on the information we have on the tested hypotheses. Introduction The logical principle of Occam's razor [1], [2], suggests choosing the simplest hypothesis among those available. In this article, we will analyze this prin ciple using the theory of statistical hypothesis test [3], [4]. By exploiting this theory, we will reformulate the fundamental problem of statistics in such a way as to bring attention to the link between the statistical data and the probability that it wa s produced randomly. Consequently, according to this point of view, among the hypotheses that perform the same prediction, we must choose the result that has a lower probability of being produced randomly. Therefore, it becomes essential to calculate this probability value correctly. This problem is addressed by redefining what is meant by hypothesis. The traditional approach considers the hypothesis as the set of rules that actively participate in the forecast. Instead, we consider as hypotheses the sum of all the hypotheses made, also considering the hypotheses preceding the one used. Therefore, each time a prediction is made, our hypothesis increases in complexity and consequently increases its ability to adapt to a random data set.

Finally, we use this new definition of hypothesis to understand the reason for the high percentage of non -reproducible results, in which the hypothesis test was used. The fundamental problem of statistics In statistics, to evaluate the significance of a result, one of the most used methods is the statistical hypothesis test. Using this theory, the fundamental problem of statistics can be Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476417 expressed as follows: \" A statistical data does not represent useful in formation, but becomes useful information only when it is shown that it was not obtained randomly \". This definition is particularly significant, because it highlights the two fundamental aspects of statistics, which are its uncertainty and the reason for its uncertainty. Indeed, the purpose of statistics is the study of phenomena in conditions of uncertainty or non -determinism by exploiting the sampling of events related to the phenomenon to be studied. Knowing that the observed events can be randomly repr oduced with a probability that will never be zero, we understand the reason for the indeterminism that characterizes the statistics. This probability value is called universal probability [5]. Through this definition of the fundamental problem of statisti cs, it is also possible to formulate the following paradox [6], which highlights how the evaluation of statistical results is dependent on each action performed on the analyzed data. The validity limit of Occam's razor principle In this paragraph, we will see how the information regarding the development of a hypothesis is fundamental to define the validity limit of Occam's razor principle. Let us start by giving some definitions useful to formalize our theory. Given an experiment that measures N values of a discrete variable X with cardinality C, we call D the set of dimension \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc41, which includes all possible sequences \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc41 of length N that can be observed. Now, we redefine the concept of hypothesis in order to define a chronological succession among the tested hypothesis. We call H(t) the hypothesis developed at time t. We call PH(t) the set of sequences \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc41\u2208\ud835\udc37 that the hypothesis H(t) is able to predict. We call NPH(t) the cardinality of the set PH(t) .

Consequently, NTPH(T) defines the number of sequences, belonging to D, that the hypothesis TH(t) is able to predict. It may happen that different hypotheses forecast the same sequence of values of X, having made the union of the sets PH(t) these sequences are calculated only o nce. If we have only made a hypothesis H(t)=TH(t) and NPH(t)=NTPH(t) .

We define the ability of the hypothesis TH(t) to predict a sequence of N casual observation s of the i.i.d. random variable X with discrete uniform distribution and cardinality C, the ratio: \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc3b (\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc41 (1) This ratio also defines the probability that the hypothesis TH(t) can predict the results of an experiment, in which the cardinality of D is equal to \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc41, in a completely random way. Knowing that a hypothesis TH(t) can predict the results of an experiment only in the following two conditions: 1) TH(t) is true. 2) TH(t) is false and the prediction occurs randomly; the probability of this event is given by equation (1). Under these conditions, the probability that the hypothesis TH(t) is true turns out to be: 1\u2212\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc3b (\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc41 (2) Consequently, this equation defines the parameter that must be used in the evaluation o f H(t).",

Consequently, they can be used as a measure of their complexity, in fact, the more complex a hypothesis is, the greater the number of results it can predict. Analyzing the four possible results, we note that even if a hypothesis H1(t) is less complex than a hypothesis H2(t) (NPH1(t)<NPH2(t) ), it is possible to have a hypothesis TH1(t) more complex than a hypothesis TH2(t) (NTPH1(t)>NTPH2(t) ). Consequently, using equation (2) as an evaluation method, hypothesis H1(t) should be discarded in favor of hypothesis H2(t) . This situation can happen, for example, if H1(t) is the last hypothesis of a long series of other hypotheses t ested previously. In the event that there is no information on the hypotheses to be evaluated, it must be assumed that the hypotheses have been developed under the same conditions. Therefore, in this case, not being able to calculate TH(t) , it is recommend ed to choose the simpler hypothesis H(t). Finally, from equation (2), we can deduce the following result: given a hypothesis H(t) the probability that is true can be calculated only if all the previously tested hypotheses are known. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476419 Consequently, the complexity of a hypothesis not only depends on the mathematical formula that makes the prediction, but also depends on all the attempts made previously. Therefore, Occam's razor principle does not have an absolute value but its applicatio n depends on the information about the hypotheses. How to perform correctly the statistical hypothesis test It is interesting to note how the definition of hypothesis, which was given in the previous paragraph, can be seen as something extremely obvious or as something extremely innovative. Indeed, it may seem absolutely banal to consider all the hypotheses that have been tested, for the obvious reason that by running a large number of random hypotheses sooner or later there will be some hypothesis that w ill fit the data quite well. On the other hand, also considering the previous hypotheses represents a revolution in the evaluation of a hypothesis. In fact, from this point of view, the mere knowledge of the hypothesis that makes the prediction does not al low us to define its real complexity. Therefore, if in the statistical hypothesis test the p -value [7], [8], used as a threshold to reject the null hypothesis, is calculated considering only the hypothesis that actively participates in the prediction, it means, that we are underestimating the complexity of the hypothesis. Consequently, the p -value, thus calculated, is wrong and therefore determines a false evaluation of the hypothesis. It is therefore believed that this systematic error, in the execution of the hypothesis test, is responsible for the high number of non -reproducible results [9], [10]. Taking advantage of these considerations it is understood that evaluating a statistical result can be very difficult because some information can be hidden. For example, we are obliged to report the mathematical formula that makes the prediction but, instead, we may not report all previous failed attempts. Unfortunately, this information is essential for evaluating the hypothesis, because they are an integral part of the hypothesis. Indeed, if we test 10 hypotheses, we simply interpolate the data with those ten hypotheses and choose the hypothesis that passes the chosen evaluation test. This problem also depends on the increasing use of statistical software ca pable of quickly executing a huge number of mathematical models. Consequently, there is the risk of \"playing\" with this software by performing a multitude of analyzes and this sooner or later leads to a random correlation. For these reasons, the evaluati on of statistical results represents one of the most important challenges for scientific research. Unfortunately, it is a difficult problem to solve because, as mentioned, some information can always be hidden when writing an article.",

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476420 Conclusion In this article, we have discussed the logical principle of Occam's razor using the hypothesis test theory. This allowed us to reformulate the fundamental problem of statistics, in such a way as to make us understand the importance of correctly calculating the probability of obtaining the same results randomly. Solving this problem involved redefining the concept of hypothesis. According to this point of view, by hypothesis we mean the sum of all tested hypotheses. Consequently, the complexity of a hypothe sis not only depends on the mathematical formula that makes the prediction but also depends on the previous hypotheses tested. Therefore, according to this approach, the logical principle of Occam's razor no longer has a general value if one considers as a hypothesis only the set of rules that actively participate in the prediction. If, on the other hand, the hypothesis is considered as the sum of all the tested hypotheses, in this case, Occam's razor principle returns to have a general value. Finally, i t is noted that not considering all the tested hypotheses causes a systematic error in the application of the statistical hypothesis test. Therefore, it is hypothesized that this error, which leads to underestimate the complexity of a hypothesis, is the ca use of the high percentage of non -reproducible scientific results.

Introduction The St. Petersburg paradox represents one of the most important paradoxes in game theory. The classic solution used to solve uses special utility functions that implement the concept of marginal utility [1], [2], [3]. This type of approach has been strongly criticized in virtue of the fact that utility functions attempt to forma lize sociological behaviour from a mathematical point of view, and this is why they always have a subjectivity component. Moreover, many studies of behavioural economics [4], [5] highlight how people\u2019s behaviour is often irrational. Consequently, the resol ution of this paradox still represents an open challenge and, as we will see, the search for an alternative solution may help us improve the decision -making process during the evaluation of a strategy. In order to understand the method proposed in this ar ticle for resolving the St. Petersburg paradox, we must first explain the origins of this method. This approach was developed to study the strategies operating on non -ergodic systems. In particular, the primary field of application is characterized by the study of quantitative trading algorithms operating on financial markets. The non-ergodicity condition can make the results dependent on each other. Therefore, in this scenario a dependency is created between data which, like in the field of finance, is dif ficult to detect and quantify. To explain to you the possible consequences at a decision -making level of this condition, I propose the following example: think about making a hundred bets on a hundred flips of a coin and winning one hundred times. In this case, you will have obtained a hundred victories independent of each other to which a very high -expected gain will be associated. You therefore reach the right conclusion that the strategy used to predict the flip of the coin is most likely Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476422 correct. Now l et's change the starting scenario and let's say we make 100 equal bets on a single coin flip, getting a hundred wins. Obviously, since the bets are completely dependent on each other, in this case they cannot be used to calculate the expected gain. In fact , it\u2019s basically as if we made a single bet. Now let\u2019s imagine, as a third and last scenario, that you are not able to see the person flipping the coin: if we win all the hundred times, we don\u2019t know if they are dependent or independent of each other. This third scenario generates a very important decision -making problem, because if I consider the results as independent and they are not, I risk overestimating the strategy. This wrong assessment can lead me to make the irrational choice of using a useless strategy. In finance the non -independence of the results creates a statistical phenomenon called clustering.",

        "content": "This statistical characteristic determines the formation of groups of high returns, alternating with groups of low returns. In other words, it means that returns are not distributed evenly but tend to cluster together. The clustering phenomenon has disastrous effects in finance, because when you are going through winning phases you are led to consider the operations carried out as independent of each o ther. This implies that the expected gain, calculated from data that we mistakenly think to be independent, is overestimated, therefore the evaluation of the strategy will also be incorrect. So, this behaviour can subject us to unexpected risk. With regard s to this topic we have developed a paradox [6], which we have called \u201cthe professional trader\u2019s paradox\u201d. The name derives from the fact that we are inclined to consider that our operations are always independent, and therefore, when we face a series of w inning bets, we tend to overestimate the strategy used. In conclusion, the expected gain, obtained from data that may not be independent, cannot be used for decision -making purposes, as it has a statistical value that is difficult to determine. Therefore , from this example we understand that there are situations, like in non -ergodic systems, where the expected gain is no longer a reliable parameter. Consequently, we can think that other situations may exist, like in the case of the infinite behaviour of t his paradox, where the expected gain is a datum that cannot be used in decision -making. We begin to understand that the problem in resolving the St. Petersburg paradox may derive from considering the expected gain, and its variants (utility functions), as the only possible point of view in the evaluation of a strategy. So, the question we have to ask ourselves is: is there a parameter that is better than the expected gain? The answer we give to this question is focused on being able to understand, from a statistical point of view, if a strategy operates in a cognitive way by exploiting useful information present on the system. The useful information in this case can be seen as a datum subject to analysis that rendered it significant to the recipient for th eir present or future decision -making process. To determine mathematically if a strategy is cognitive, in the sense just described, we exploit the Von Mises' axiom of randomness. The axiom defines the statistical characteristic that must have a sequence in order to be considered random. The axiom is the following: \"the essential requirement for a sequence to be defined as random consists in the complete absence of any rules that may be successfully applied to improve predictions about the next number \". The meaning of this axiom is the following: when we understand a set of rules to which a numerical sequence is subject we can obtain results, intended as forecasts on the next number of the sequence, whose probability of being reproduced randomly tends towar d zero on increasing the number of forecasts made. Consequently, the results obtained with a game strategy that implements information useful to improve our probability of winning, generates results that cannot be reproduced randomly. Basically, the proba bility of obtaining better results with a random strategy compared to a Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476423 cognitive strategy, which implements useful information, tends toward zero as the number of predictions made increases. This axiom is indeed a statistical method for evaluating the res ults obtained, without taking into consideration the absolute value of the expected gain. In fact, this method is based solely on the fact of being able to discriminate whether the results were obtained with a random strategy or through a cognitive strateg y that implements a set of rules to which the system is subject. In this way we obtain a fundamental result in analysing the strategies of a particular class of zero-sum games, where there is a balance between the participants. Balance means the situation where none of the players has an implicit advantage over the others. The famous mathematician Daniel Bernoulli defined this particular class of games as: \u201cmathematically fair game of chance\u201d.",

If we analyse the results obtained by repeating the game of chance described in the St. Petersburg paradox a large number of times, in the next paragrap h we will demonstrate that better profits can be obtained with a probability that tends toward 50% by using a random strategy. In practice, the results of a purely random game strategy tend to be distributed symmetrically with respect to the expected theor etical gain derived from the strategy described in the paradox. This result indicates that the doubling -down strategy after each lost bet does not exploit any kind of useful information, and therefore it is a completely non -cognitive game method. Consequen tly, by taking the cognitive aspect as a parameter to be used in decision -making, and having demonstrated the complete absence within the strategy, we are able to solve the paradox by proving the irrationality of the game method. In this article, we wan t to introduce the cognitive aspect, understood in the sense of acting in a non -random way by exploiting useful information about the system, as a fundamental element for improving the decisions theory. In fact, this paradox is useful to make us understand that the knowledge of useful information about the system, capable of increasing our probability of victory, always involves an increase of the expected gain. However, the opposite is not true: an expected gain that tends to infinity does not imply that t he strategy exploits knowledge about the system and therefore is cognitive and not random. Consequently, a hierarchy of values is created, where the cognitive aspect is more important than the expected gain for decision -making purposes. Resolution of the St. Petersburg paradox In this paragraph, we will solve the St. Petersburg paradox by demonstrating that the doubling -down strategy after each lost bet is a non -cognitive strategy, which implements no useful information that can be used to improve the prob ability of success. In order to do this we have to define the random strategy, which we will use to calculate the probability of obtaining better results than those obtained with the gambling method defined in the paradox. In fact, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, this probability should tend to zero if the strategy being evaluated is a cognitive strategy that implements useful information. Firstly, we define some parameters that are fundamental to characterize our random strategy of reference. The first parameter we need is the expected value EV of the game obtained by using the Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476424 doubling -down strategy after each bet lost. Given a number of flips equal to L, with a 50% probability of winning and placing the value of the first bet equal to 1, we ha ve: \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49=\ud835\udc3f 2 The second parameter is the average bet AB. By carrying out L bets of Bn value, we have: \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35=(\ud835\udc351+\ud835\udc352\u2026+\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3f) \ud835\udc3f Knowing that the first bet B1 is equal to 1, and double downing after every bet lost and returning to value 1 when we win the bet, we have: \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35=\u2211(\ud835\udc3f\u2212\ud835\udc5b+1)2\ud835\udc5b\u22121 2\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc5b=2+1 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35=\u2211(\ud835\udc3f\u2212\ud835\udc5b+1) 2\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc5b=2+1 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35=\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc3f\u22121) 21 2\ud835\udc3f+1 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35=\ud835\udc3f\u22121 4+1 At this point the random game strategy will be defined as follows: given a number of flips equal to L, L bets of AB constant value will be made, randomly choo sing whether to bet heads or tails on each bet. To calculate whether a strategy of this type can obtain better results compared to the expected value EV of the strategy of the paradox, just use the binomial distribution formula. \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc3f,\ud835\udc5d)=(\ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc58)\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc58(1\u2212\ud835\udc5d)\ud835\udc3f\u2212\ud835\udc58 P = probability of winning K = number of wins L = number of tosses By using the binomial distribution formula, given a value of L, we can obtain the probability of achieving better results with the random strategy described above.

FIG. 1 : Probability of obtaining better results with a random strategy, given a number of L tosses ranging from 10 to 200. Conclusion In this article we use the St. Petersburg paradox to introduce a parameter related to the cognitive aspect of a strategy, as a fundamental element to help our decision -making in all those situations where the expected gain turns out to be an unreliable parameter. This approach was developed by studying non -ergodic systems. In this scenario the results can be non -independent, so the expected gain becomes a parameter with a statistical value that is difficult to determine. Therefore, it cannot be used in decision -making and a new parameter needs to be found. The parameter chosen is related to the strategy\u2019s ability to operate in a cognitive way (the cognitive term indicates the strategy\u2019s ability to operate in a non -random way by exploiting useful information about the system, capable of making us increase the probability of victory). To determine mathematically if a strategy is cognitive, we used the von Mises' axiom of randomness. Based on this axiom, strategies that implement useful information about the system generate results that cannot be reproduced randomly. Thus, we compared the paradox strategy with a completely rando m but equivalent strategy from the point of view of the total betting value. From this comparison, we have demonstrated that the random strategy gets better results with a probability that tends toward 50% as the number of tosses increases. Basically, the strategy Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476426 tends to converge to a random strategy instead of diverging as we would expect from a cognitive strategy. In fact, if a strategy implements useful information on the system, the probability of randomly obtaining better results tends toward zero. T his result indicates that the doubling -down strategy after each lost bet is not a cognitive strategy that exploits useful information about the system, and therefore by taking the cognitive aspect as an evaluation parameter we have solved the paradox. In conclusion, the St. Petersburg paradox teaches us that an expected gain that tends toward infinity does not always imply the presence of a cognitive and non -random strategy. Thus knowledge, meaning the exploitation of useful information capable of making us increase the probability of victory, always implies an increase in the expected gain, but the opposite is not true; an expected gain that tends toward infinity can also be obtained in the absence of knowledge about the system. Consequently, from the dec ision -making aspect we can create a hierarchy of values, where knowledge is more important than the expected gain. In fact, the expectation of victory can be difficult to estimate as in the case of non -ergodic systems or be a non -useful data if the develop ed strategy has a high degree of overfitting. In all these cases the calculation of the probability of obtaining the same results randomly becomes a much more reliable parameter, since this datum is influenced only by the real knowledge we have of the syst em and not by the noise. In fact, a statistical datum does not represent a useful information, but becomes a useful information only when it is possible to proof that it was not obtained in a random way. In practice, the probability of obtaining the same r esult randomly must be very low in order to consider the result useful.

Since this probability depends on all the actions performed, two fundamental results can be deduced. Each of our random a nd therefore unnecessary actions always involves an increase in the uncertainty of the phenomenon to which the statistical data refers. Each of our non-random actions always involves a decrease in the uncertainty of the phenomenon to which the statistical data refers. Introduction This article proves the following sentence: \"The only thing that cannot be created randomly is knowledge \" A true story of a true coincidence Ann is a researcher, is a clever and beautiful researcher, one day she decides to do the following experiment: she wants to understand if she has some special abilities that allow her to extract the number 1 from a bag containing one hundred different numbers mixed in a random way. Day 1, Ann takes the bag and randomly pulls out a number. The drawn number is not 1, so she failed, the drawn number is put back into the bag. Day 2, Ann takes the bag and randomly pulls out a number. The drawn number is not 1, so she failed, the drawn number is put back into the bag. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 The days pass an d Ann fails every attempt but continues his experiment. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Day 100, Ann takes the bag and randomly pulls out a number. The number drawn is 1, so she is successful. The probability of finding number 1 by performing a random extraction is 1/100; th is value represents an acceptable error that makes the result significant to support the hypothesis that the extraction is non -random. But Ann knows that this probability does not represent the uncertainty of her success, because this value does not take i nto account previous attempts. Therefore, she calculates the probability of randomly extracting the number 1, at least once, in a hundred attempts. The probability value thus calculated is 63%, since this value is very high, she cannot consider the success obtained as significant statistical data to support the hypothesis that the extraction is non - random. Ann concludes the experiment and deduces, from the results obtained, that she has no special ability and the extractions are all random. John is a dat a scientist, one day he is entrusted with the following task: he has to develop an algorithm capable of predicting the result of an experiment whose result is determined by a value from 1 to 100.

The first article \u201cDescription of a method of econophysics as a technique for verifying a financial strategy\u201d deals with all the fundamental topics in the development of a quantitative trading system. Indeed, in addition to evaluating a trading strategy, this article also talks about many other aspects, such as the development of control methods on a running strat egy. The successive articles concern the non -ergodicity of the financial markets. In this situation, the data can be non -independent, so their statistical significance is difficult to define. Under these conditions, the risk associated with a trading algo rithm is defined by its ability to predict the evolution of the system. Whenever a correct forecast is made on an evolution of the system, this forecast generates data that is independent of the previous data. From a statistical point of view, the independ ence of the data determines a lower probability of obtaining an equal or better result randomly. Consequently, this probability value is indicative of the number of correctly predicted system evolutions. As we have seen in the statistics articles, this par ameter also represents the uncertainty of the statistical data.

        "content": "We start from the principal question asked by anyone involved in financi al investments: Are the results obtained due to a correct interpretation of the market, or are they merely fortuitous? This is a plain question and it can be given an equally clear answer. The results obtained are due to a correct interpretation of the mar ket if the probability of obtaining equal or better results randomly is very small (i.e. tends to zero as the number of times the strategy is used increases). Description of the methodology The logic underlying this method is very simple in essence: it consists in calculating the probability of obtaining the same results randomly. As we will see in the examples below, this technique is applied not only to results from a trial phase: it is also applied as a control method when the strategy is used on a real trading account. In what follows, I present a short logical proof of the soundness of this method. The term \u2018soundness\u2019 was introduced by the famous mathematician David Hilbert and is used to indicate the absence of any contradiction within a mathematical logical proof. Indeed, contradiction is one of the main defects of methods of analysis based on equity line (performance) assessment. The short demonstration I\u2019m going to outline is based on two fundamental axioms: 1) Whenever we understand any kind of deterministic market process, the probability of our financial operation being successful increases by more than 50% (Von Mises\u2019 axiom of disorder from the early 1920s). 2) The probability of randomly obtaining a result that has been obtained through cognitive awareness of a deterministic market process tends to zero as the number of times the strategy is used increases. The first axiom is derived from the famous \u201caxiom of randomness\u201d (or the \u2018principle of the impossibility of a gambling system\u2019) formulated by the mathematician Von Mises, whose original definition I quote: \u201cthe essential requirement for a sequence to be defined as random consists in the complete absence of any rules that may be successfully applied to improve predictions about the next number\u201d. As a consequence of the two axioms given above, any correct market analysis will always tend to increase the probability of our prediction beyond the 50% mean, and this results in a consequent decrease in the probability of obtaining the same result randomly. I will demonstrate this to you with a simple example. Suppose we are playing heads or tails with a rigged coin that gives us an above -50% probability of winning (let\u2019s say it\u2019s 60%). What is the probability of losing out after 10 coin tosses? Approximately 16.6% ...and after 50 tosses? Approximately 5.7% ...and after 100 tosses? Approximately 1.7%. As you can see, the probability tends to zero, and here the rigged coin represents a financial strategy that is implementing a correct Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476431 market analysis. By basing our method of assessment specifically on the calculation of this probability, we develop a method that is by definition free of contradictions. The absolute value of the probability turns out to be a sound estimate of the validity of our strategy. The term \u2018deterministic process\u2019 which I used during the proof refers to the utilisation of a correct financial strategy, definable as the identification of a deterministic and non -random component that regulates the system we are studying (in our case, a financial market). Methods based on studying the equity line may produce a positive outcome and at the same time have a 50% probability of obtaining the same amount of profit by chance. In this way, such methods lead to a contradiction, given that obtaining the same outcome randomly implies the absence of a cognitive process, which is just what is meant by assuming a \u201ccorrect interpretation of the market\u201d. These kind of methods are often based on the market stationary hypothesis (ergodic hypothesis). This hypothesis is considered by many experts not correct, on this topic have been written many article s the most famous is that written by the Nobel prize for physics Gell -Mann [1], two other interesting articles on this topic are [2], [3].",

The algorithm is defined as follows: Each day you toss a coin to decide whether to open a buy position on the Nasdaq Index. The interval time chosen is from 1 January 2016 to 31 July 2017. If the position is opened, you toss another coin the next day to decide whether to close it or leave it open. As you can appreciate, this strategy functions in a completely inane and random way. Nevertheless, the equity line achieved is satisfactory: indeed, if we calculate the probability of obtaining an equivalent or better result randomly, we get a probability of approximately 50%. We therefore know that the result is void of significance, in spite of the equity line. To conclude, it follows tha t the parameter to be linked to the validity of a financial strategy is not its performance but its statistical property of generating non -reproducible results in a random way. Figure 1: shows the equity line of a purely random trading system in which operations are opened and closed by simulating the toss of a coin. 0100200300400500600700800900 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450Profit Number of trades Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476432 Description of the techniques used in operational practice of this verification method How does one calculate the probability of randomly generating an equivalent or better performanc e? There are two ways: the first (and more precise) is to estimate this probability using the Monte Carlo method. The accuracy of this method is linked to the number of times we carry out the simulation. Its strength is the ability to obtain very precise v alues: its drawback is due mainly to the long calculation times required to obtain the estimate of probability. The second method (which I have identified) uses exact formulae taken from statistics; each formula is applied to a particular class of random variables. Unfortunately, financial operations do not fall under any type within this class of variables. This problem is solved by applying a transform to the financial operations, which renders them suitable for the chosen analytical formula. This transform adds an error to the calculation of our probability, but it has the advantage of being calculable in on e single equation and therefore without requiring massive computational resources, as do the Monte Carlo methods. Use of the method as a control parameter of a strategy This method is utilised not just during the test phase, but is also extremely use ful as a way of monitoring the trading system. Each time we carry out an operation, we update the probability value for obtaining that result randomly. We do not calculate this probability across the whole sample of operations conducted, but extrapolate it from to the N most recent operations. The optimal value for N depends on the strategy, and in particular on the frequency with which operations are conducted over time. Once N has been set, we calculate our probability and compare it with a probability we have established that represents the level of risk we take to be acceptable (this definition of risk will be explained in a separate section). If the probability value exceeds the parameter set by us, the trading system locks itself and continues trading in virtual mode only. When the probability falls below the threshold parameter we have set, the trading system resumes actual trading. In this way, trades are effected only when the market is understood, and the trading system is blocked when we are operat ing in a regime considered to be random. This method is much more efficient than the usual performance -based methodologies; such methods carry the risk of allowing themselves to incur unnecessary losses. It may happen with this method that the strategy is blocked even when trading at a profit, given that a random regime has a 50% probability of success. Having said this, obviously a trading system will have its internal performance controls, but their purpose is purely to monitor for possible system c rashes or any programming bugs. What we have described thus far can be fine -tuned.",

        "content": "A characteristic of all good quantitative trading systems is to be capable of operating even at high frequencies while leaving unchanged the logical schema on which the trading system is based. This ena bles us to run a trading system solely as a method of monitoring (hence in virtual mode), at a very high frequency of operations, and to obtain thereby a much more numerous statistical sample in less time, increasing the reactivity of our method of control . Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476433 Use of the method to in the process of developing a financial strategy This approach has another great merit, which is to help us direct our research in the right direction. Let us assume we develop two strategies: 1) The first has profits on a hist oric series of 10% annuities, but with a very high probability of obtaining the same results randomly; 2) a second, instead, has low profits of 1%, but with an extremely low probability of obtaining the same results randomly. It is perfectly obvious that, if we follow the theory we have expounded, we will discard the first strategy, as there is a very high probability that the 10% profit has been obtained by mere chance. The second strategy yields low profits but the low probability value obtained means we are on the right track for understanding a deterministic and non -random market process (which, if studied more closely, could lead to more profitable financial strategies). If we had not applied this method, we might have thought that the first strategy (with higher gains) was the right one. But this would have been at risk of losing money over the medium to long term. We would have ended by discarding the second strategy and missing an opportunity to study and understand something important we had sensed about the market. Example of the use of this methodology I report the following practical example; the figure shows the trend of a hypothetical stock. The value of this stock on a thousand time intervals rises one unit 60% of the time and goes down by one unit 40% of the time. In order to simplify the calculatio ns the price movement is unitary. Now let us look at two strategies that execute 500 trades, each trade lasts an interval of time. The first strategy execute only buys and in order to choose when to buy, flips a coin, if it win opens a trades if loses it waits for the next unit of time and repeats the operation. The second strategy, on the other hand, is a strategy that sells only, but does not do it in a random way, it uses information that allows it a 10% advantage in determining the drops of the value s tock. The first strategy gets a profit of 100 by winning 60% of trades. Now we calculate the probability of obtaining a better result in a random way, to do this we use the binomial cumulative distribution function with the following parameters: p = 60% (probability of win) k > 300 (number of wins) L = 500 (total number of tests) The probability of victory is 60% because in the graph shown the value of the stock rises by one unit 60% of the time and goes down by one unit 40% of the time. Using thes e data, we get a probability to get better results randomly of the 48.3%. Now let us consider the second strategy, this strategy has a total result of zero in practice it performs 250 winning trades and 250 losing trades (the 10% advantage allows it to increase the probability of victory from 40% to 50%). Also in this case, we calculate the probability of obtaining better results randomly, to do this we use the formula of the binomial cumulative distribution function with the following parameters: Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476434 p = 40 % k > 250 L = 500 Using these data, we get a probability to get better results randomly of the 2.5\u221910\u22124 %.",

        "content": "Analyzing these results it is clear that the profit of 100 made by the first strategy is not significant and this evaluation is correct because we know that the strategy flip a coin in order to decide whether to open a buy position. The second strategy does not make any profit but such a low probability makes this result significant and even this evaluation is correct, in fact we know that this strategy implements useful information that allows it to increase the probability of victory by 10%. What would have happened if we had used the competition evalua tion method? We will have discarded the second strategy and reward the first strategy, a completely random strategy. Where is the error? The error derives from considering result as an always useful element for future profits instead the fundamental elemen t to be winning is to be able to understand the rules to which a system is subject, in this case the financial market. This knowledge allows us to act in a non -random way and this feature can be detected only if we calculate the probability of obtaining be tter results at random. A new definition of risk There are many definitions of risk in the financial field: risk is in any case seen as the probability (uncertainty) of incurring a given loss. If we recall the statistical example given above of tossin g the rigged coin, we can see how risk is intimately linked to our understanding of the market and as such how it tends to zero the more times we repeat the statistical experiment described above. The value of this probability can never be zero: think, for example, of the actions we perform in our daily lives, actions that all have a certain level of risk \u2013 understood as the probability of bringing about a negative event. We take these actions into consideration nevertheless, because we know that Figura 2: trend of a stock that rises 60% of the time and falls the remaining 40%. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476435 the ri sk associated with them is so low as to be statistically acceptable \u2013 for example the risks associated with travelling by plane. It therefore becomes extremely important to implement methods that evaluate the validity of our strategy in a sound way, so that we can estimate risk and plan the investment correctly. Conclusion In this article, I wanted to draw your attention to a different way of viewing the performance of a trading system, a way that is not bound to its absolute value, but linked to one of its statistical properties. As I demonstrated in the first section, th is involves well defined behaviours when we operate with cognitive awareness on the market. The approach is a fundamental one because it recognises the high likelihood of being successful on financial markets, even over long periods, in a completely random way. Let\u2019s not forget that financial markets have only two possible directions. This implies that, even fortuitously, there is a 50% chance of making the right choice. Furthermore, such trends can continue for years. Therefore, it is crucial to look away from the profit line and to appreciate in a rigorous and scientific way whether our strategies are the product of chance or of a true understanding of the market. One thus trades only if one understands the market, thereby actually reducing the element of fortuitousness. Investing in this way has nothing to do with chance but becomes cognitively aware and more secure. Gambling is defined as follows: \u201cThe gaming activity in which profit is sought after and in which winning or losing occurs predominately b y chance, skill being of negligible importance \u201d From this definition, it follows that if the element of fortuitousness is not factored into the investment decision -making process, it is never possible to prove that money invested is free of exposure to chance, and therefore to uncontrolled risk. The calculation of probability illustrated above therefore becomes an essential and irreplaceable requirement for bringing investment out of the area of gambling, making it more cognitively aware, and therefore l ess risky.

In this paradox, we have two people sitting at a table separ ated by a black sheet so that they cannot see each other and are playing the following game: the person we call A flip a coin and the person we'll call B tries to guess the outcome of the coin flip. At the end of the game, both people are asked to estimate the compound probability of the result obtained. The two people give two different answers, one estimates the events as independent and the other one considers the events as dependent, therefore they calculate the conditional probability differently. This paradox show how the erroneous estimation of conditional probability implies a strong distortion of the forecasting skill, that can lead us to bear excessive risks. The professional trader\u2019s paradox In order to explain how much danger is considering the financial returns as independent, I want to present to you this paradox. We have two people sitting at a table separated by a black sheet so that they cannot see each other and are playing the follo wing game: the person we call A flip a coin and the person we'll call B tries to guess the outcome of the coin toss. This game lasts an arbitrary time interval and the person A has the freedom to choose how many tosses to make during the chosen time interv al, the person B does not see the coin toss but can at any time, within the time interval, make a bet. When he makes a bet if he guesses the state the coin is in now, he wins. The person A decides to make a single coin flip (just at the beginning of the ga me) we say that the result is head, the person B decides within the same time interval to make two equal bets, betting both times on the exit of the head. The result is that B made two winning bets. Now we ask ourselves this question: what is the correct compound probability associated with the result of this game? Let us ask this question to the person B who answers: every time I had bet I could choose between head and cross so I had a 50% chance of winning the bet; I won two bets so the compound probabil ity is 0.5\u22190.5=25% . Now let us say the same question to A the person who flip the coin, he replies: the probability is 50% I have flip the coin only one time within the defined time interval, so its prediction probability cannot be higher at 50% . The fact that the other player has made two bets has in practice only divided a bet in two is a bit 'as if to the racecourse we are made two distinct bets on the same horse on the same race, this way of acting does not increase the forecasting skill. Both answers seem more than reasonable, but as every mathematical paradox, the two answers contradict each other. At this point, will you ask yourself which of the two answers is correct? We can resolve this paradox using the mathematical formula of the compound prob ability: P(E1 \u2229 E2) = P(E1 | E2) P(E2) = P(E2 | E1) P(E1). The probability that both events (E1, E2) occur is equal to the probability that E1 occurs P(E1) multiplied by the conditional probability of E2 given E1, P(E2 | E1). Seeing the formula, we immed iately understand that the difference in response given by A and B is due to the different estimation of conditional probability P(E2 | E1).",

Which of the two answers is correct? The right answer is given by the person who has the knowledge to correctly es timate the conditional probability P(E2 | E1) and between the two players only the person that flip the coin can correctly estimate the conditional probability. Player B, on the other hand, not being able to see A that flip the coin, therefore he does not have the necessary information to estimate this probability correctly. Another way to understand this result can be found analysing the following question: what is the probability in this game of winning twice in a row by betting both times on the head? The answer to this question is not always the same but it depends if after the first bet the person that flip the coin performs a new launch or not. If you make a new launch, the probability is 0.5 \u2219 0.5=25% if instead as in the case of this paradox no furth er coin flip is performed the probability is 50% . So, in order to answer correctly, you need to know the number of launch made and this information is knows only from the person (A) that perform the coin flip and he's the only one can be correctly calculat e the conditional probability. If we bring this paradox on the financial markets, we understand that player A represent the financial instruments and player B represent the traders who try to beat the market. This gives us an extremely important result: a ll the traders make the same mistake, doing the same thing that player B did in this paradox. They consider their trades as completely independent of each other and this involves as we have seen, a strong distortion of the forecasting skill that can lead t he traders to acquiring a false security that may lead them to bear excessive risks. Player B, like the traders, think that the statistical information about his forecasting skill depends on his choice (I choose head instead of cross, I buy instead of sel ling) this is a big mistake because this statement is true only when these kinds of bets are independent of each other. In practice, this statement is true only when I place a bet by event in this case, the results are independent of each other and therefo re these bets have a statistical meaning. The problem is that in everyday life this equivalence is always respected. Therefore, our brain considers this equivalence always true so when we make trading we mistakenly consider our operations as independent despite the statistical evidence of non -independence (non -normal distribution of the results). Conclusion In this short article, I wanted to introduce one of the most important topics in finance, which concerns the non -independence of the results. Considering the financial returns as independent is equivalent to considering the financial markets stationary ( ergodic hypothesis). This hypothesis is considered by many experts not correct, on this topic have been written many articles [1], [2], [3]. What is the reason why such significant statistical evidence has been ignored, the main reason is the total lack o f methods able to estimate the conditional probability P (A | B). In my previous article [4] I have explained an innovative method used in order to evaluate a financial strategy under the condition of the market non -stationary hypothesis (non -ergodic hypo thesis). This approach is based on the axiom of disorder (von Mises), this mathematical axiom applied on financial markets can be enunciated in this way: Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476438 \"Whenever we understand any kind of deterministic market process, the probability of our financial operation being successful increases by more than 50% \" (Von Mises\u2019 axiom of disorder from the early 1920s).",

        "content": "As a consequence of this axiom given above, any correct market analysis will always tend to increase the probability of our prediction beyond the 50% mean, and this results in a consequent decrease in the probability of obtaining the same result randomly. To conclude, it follows that the parameter to be linked to the validity of a financial strategy, is not its performance but its statistical property of generating non -reproducible results in a random way. I will demonstrate this to you with a simple ex ample. Suppose we are playing heads or tails with a rigged coin that gives us an above -50% probability of winning (let\u2019s say it\u2019s 60%). What is the probability of losing out after 10 coin tosses? Approximately 16.6% ...and after 50 tosses? Approximately 5. 7% ...and after 100 tosses? Approximately 1.7%. As you can see, the probability tends to zero, and here the rigged coin represents a financial strategy that is implementing a correct market analysis. Now we return to the paradox that I exposed and we note how the presence of a dependence between the first and the second bet has modified the conditional probability of the second one from 0.5 to 1. This increase of the conditional probability has the consequence that the result of the second bet can be obtai ned randomly. In fact, if we move the second bet randomly within the time interval from the first bet to the second one, the result is always the same because the player who flip the coin (player A) does not execute other coin tosses in this time interval . Consequently, the second bet cannot be considered to evaluate the forecast skill. Therefore, considering a system not stationary involves a reduction of the number of events to be considered for a statistical evaluation so if a data set proves to be stat istically significant under the condition of stationarity of the system, the same data set may no longer be statistically significant if the system is considered non -stationary.

This numerical sequence allows us to use the Von Mises\u2019 axiom of randomness as an analysis method concerning the results obtained from the forecasts on the evolutions of a non -stationary system. The meaning of this axiom is as follows: when we understand a pattern about a numerical sequence, we obtain results, intended as forecast on the next sequence number, which cannot be reproduced randomly. In practice, this axiom defines a statistical method capable of understanding, if the results have been obtained by a random algor ithm or by a cognitive algorithm that implements a pattern present in the system. This approach is particularly useful for analysing non -stationary systems, whose characteristic is to generate non -independent results and therefore not statistically signifi cant. The most important example of a non -stationary system are financial markets, and for this reason, the primary application of this method is the analysis of trading strategies.

Then we also introduce a temporal progression represented by a series of increasing integers. With these two sequences, we can characterize a dynamic that describes the evolution of the system that we are studying. In this way, we can apply the Von Mises\u2019 axiom of randomness, which defines the statistical characteristic of a random sequence. The axiom is as follows: \u201c the essential requirement for a sequence to be defined as random consis ts in the complete absence of any rules that may be successfully applied to improve predictions about the next number \u201d. This axiom tells us that when we understand a pattern about a numerical sequence, we can obtain results, intended as forecast on the ne xt sequence number, which cannot be reproduced randomly. Knowing that the values of our numerical sequence represent the dynamics of a system, we have found a method to evaluate the results. Therefore, if the probability of obtaining equal or better result s randomly is very small (i.e. tends to zero as the number of times the strategy is used increases), it means that the forecasting method uses rules present in the system. Consequently, we can use the developed method in order to predict the evolution of t he system; this approach is fundamental in the study of non -stationary systems. In fact, if we are in a condition of non -stationarity, the results can be non -independent, the consequence of which is a reduction in their statistical value. In order to expla in such a complex topic in a simple way, I have created a paradox [1], in which two players challenge each other in a game, where is possible to move from a stationary to a non -stationary condition by changing the rules of the game. The consequence is that the data at the beginning are independent, and then once the changes are made, they become dependent on each other and therefore useless for statistical purposes. For that reason, a large number of data obtained under these conditions, can be not statist ically useful in order to understand if the method that produced the data is not random. In this case, the performance Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476440 of the forecasting algorithm is no longer a reliable data; therefore we need to find a new statistical indicator in order to evaluate the results. In fact it happens very often in finance, that a strategy that despite having obtained excellent results by performing a numerous number of operations, suddenly stop working generating large losses, proving in this way to be a completely random s trategy. There are many researches on the non -stationarity of the financial markets; some articles about this topic are [2], [3], [4], [5]. Description of the dynamics of a non -stationary system by means of a numerical sequence We start by considering a non -stationary system characterized by two degrees of freedom. We made this choice for two reasons: first in order to simplify the treatment, second among the systems with two degree of freedom there are the financial markets, th at represent the primary application of the method that we will go to expose. Then we associate to this system a succession of values that can vary between 1 and 2. In practice when on this system there is a change in the direction in which a determinis tic process is acting, we have the result that the value of the succession change respect to the previous term. When we speak of \"deterministic process\", we indicate a deterministic and non -random force that acts on the system. We also introduce the simpli fication that the deterministic process acts as a constant force, without variations in intensity in the direction of the two degrees of freedom; this allows us to characterize the dynamics of the system with a single numeric succession.",

Application of the Von Mises\u2019 axiom of randomness as an a nalysis method concerning the results obtained by a forecasting algorithm At this point, we are going to apply the Von Mises\u2019 axiom of randomness in order to evaluate the results obtained by a forecasting algorithm. According to the axiom, reported and analysed in the introduction of this article, if we have developed a non -random method that implements a pattern present in the system, we will be able to predict when the term of the succession varies respect the previous term. This statement is crucial, because we are saying that only the forecasts concerning system changes are useful in order to understand whether the method used is random or not. In fact, if we make two forecasts about two terms of the succession at time 8 and 12, betting that the value of the succession is two, we obtain two successes. Are these two results i ndependent of each other? This question is fundamental, because only if they are independents are useful for statistical purposes in order to evaluate the forecasting method. In order to answer to this question we must use the formula of the compound prob ability that we report: P (E1\u2229E2) = P (E1 | E2) P (E2) = P (E2 | E1) P (E1) (1) The probability that both events (E1, E2) occurs, is equal to the probability that E1 occurs P(E1), multiplied by the conditional probability of E2 give n E1 occurs P(E2 | E1). Seeing formula (1) we understand that the correct calculation of conditional probability P (E2 | E1) depends on whether the events are independent or not. In fact, in the case of independent events P(E2 | E1) = P(E2), instead in th e case of events completely dependent on each other P (E2 | E1) = 1 or 0. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476442 In our example the probability P(E1) = 1/8. In fact, the probability of winning in a random way betting that the value of the sequence within the first 8 time positions is equal to 2 is 1/8, since in the first seven positions the sequence has value 1 and only at the eighth position has value 2. In practice, we can see this value like the probability of a random draw of a marble with the value 2 from a bag that contains eight marbles, seven of them with the value 1 and one with the value 2. Therefore, P (E1) represents the probability of obtaining the same result using a random strategy. In this way, we are able to derive a probability from a succession of data concerning the dynamics of the system. Now we try to calculate the value of P (E2); studying the time interval from the ninth position to the twelfth position, we see that the system remains constant. Therefore, the probability of betting randomly on the value 2 and win, within of this time interval, it is equal to 1.",

        "content": "This is because all positions have value two, so a random strategy obtains the same result with a probability of 100%. In this case, we can treat the second bet as completely dependent from the first bet. This mean s that we can consider the two bets, from the statistical point of view, like a single bet. Now let's try to shift the second bet from the twelfth position to the twentieth position, in this case we will have P(E2) = 5/7. In fact, in the time interval fro m the ninth position to the twentieth position, there are seven values equal to 1 and five values equal to 2. With this variation in the second forecast, the compound probability will be equal to: P (E1\u2229E2) = P (E1) P (E2 | E1) = P (E1) P (E2) = 1/8 \u2219 5/7 = 0.089 The two events in this case are independent of each other, so they are useful for statistical purposes in order to understand if the method used can predict the evolution of the system. From these two examples, we can deduce the following conclusion : when we want to study a deterministic process, every time that it determines a change in the system, we have the possibility to execute a predic tion on the evolution of the system, whose probability of success with a random strategy turns out to be minor 1. This involves a decrease in the compound probability whose meaning, according to the Von Mises' axiom of randomness, is to indicate the presen ce of a deterministic process that acts on the system. In practice, whenever that a deterministic process changes the system status, we can detect it by making a prediction. Consequently, in order to detect a deterministic process with a low error, it is necessary that it has produced a statistically significant number of variations in the system. On which our forecasting method has carried out a large number of independent predictions. Therefore, every forecast must concern a single variation of the syste m. This approach is crucial for non -stationary systems where the forecasts may be not independent. For that reason, it is fundamental to calculate the compound probability, which is the probability of obtaining the same results in a random way. We also re member that within the compound probability (1), there is the calculation of the conditional probability, in which it is taken into account if the events are dependent or independent from each other. In fact, the goal of this method is to discard all non - independent forecasts, whose contribution is to make me overestimate the forecast skill of the algorithm. The consequence of this erroneous evaluation can lead us, for example in the financial field, to bear excessive risks. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476443 Conclusion The analysis of results, concerning the evolution of a non -stationary system, represents one of the most important problems of applied mathematics still unresolved. In this article, I propose the use of the Von Mises\u2019 axiom of randomness as a method of evaluating the data obtained under these conditions. This axiom, as explained previously, defines a statistical characteristic that assumes a well-defined behaviour when we operate consciously. In practice, the results generated by a non - random forecasting algorithm, that im plements knowledge about the considered system, cannot be reproduced randomly. Consequently, the probability of obtaining equal or better results randomly tends to zero as the number of times the strategy is used increases. In this way, we shift our attent ion from the value of the result, which under the non -stationary condition may have been produced with non-independent forecasts, to its statistical characteristic correlated to its non -random behaviour. In order to apply this method, we have defined a si mple mathematical model whose task is to describe the dynamics of a system by means of a numerical sequence. Using this mathematical model, we have shown how to compute compound probability from a series of results obtained with a forecasting algorithm. Then, analysing some examples, we have deduced some important considerations.",

The consequence of this is a decrease of the compound probability whose meaning, according to the Von Mises\u2019 axiom of randomness, is to indicate the presence of a pattern on the system . Therefore, if we want to detect it with a low error we must have made a statistically sig nificant number of independent predictions, concerning each a single variation of the system. In this way, the forecast algorithm proves to be able to predict future system evolutions. This characteristic, therefore, becomes fundamental in estimating the r isk of a strategy that operates on a non -stationary system, such as the financial markets. In fact, a correct risk assessment must always take in considerations the forecast skill of the algorithm about the future evolutions of the system. In the next art icle, we will introduce a purely random component within the dynamics of a non - stationary system. In this way the deterministic process will be replaced by a stochastic process described by a probability density function.

This attitude is fundamental, because in the financial markets, being characterized by a low number of degrees of freedom, it is particularly easy to obtain good results randomly. Therefore, in these conditions, the result can be a little significant. Consequently, developing a dissociation from the result is essential in order not to overestimate your trading strategy. Indeed, future results depend on our knowledge of the system on which we make predictions and not on past results. In the second article, we show how meditation is an efficacious mental training method to improve our approach to problem solving. The importance of this type of practice derives from its ability to reduce our irration al and therefore random actions. As we have seen in previous articles, acting randomly is not only useless but also increases the uncertainty of future results. Therefore, this last article, despite talking about a topic that seems to be distant from the t opic covered in this book, completes all the concepts discussed previously.

This characteristic can be summarized with the following concept: \"dissociation from the result\" . This type of mental predisposition is very important, because the way we relate to the result affects our ability to behave rationally. The basic feature of the human mind To understand how the mind behaves in relation to the result of the actions, we must understand the environment in which it evolved. Man has evolve d in a context in which the link between action and result has always been very strong. The non -randomness of the result has an important consequence: if the action leads to a benefit, the action that generated it turns out to be correct. Therefore, a very strong connection is created between the action and the result. Consequently, to a useful result for our survival we are led to consider the action performed as rational and correct.",

In practice, the brain rewards us for the action done and wants it to be repeated over time because considered useful for our survival. How the mind is deceived Now we analyze how a mind, evolved und er the circumstances described in the previous paragraph, behaves when it has to face situations in which the outcome of the result is subject to a significant random component. In these situations, an extremely important thing happens: the result of our a ction will never be constant but will have a certain degree of randomness. In this situation, the link between action and result is broken, and it is no longer true that a useful result corresponds to a rational action. Situations in which there is no link between the rationality of the action and the result are situations almost exclusively created by man as in the case of gambling. For example, if we play heads or tails, we have 50% of probability to win and 50% to lose, and obviously, there is no rationa l link between action and result. However, for the brain it makes no difference, if you win a bet it will reward you with a feeling of happiness and this is because for our mind the link between result and action still exists. For this reason, the psycholo gical pathology called ludopathy, that afflicts gamblers, is the direct consequence of an evolved mind in an environment where there is a very strong link between action and result. In this situation, the mind is deceived and considers actions that are irr ational and destructive as rational and useful. This behavior is also called cognitive distortion, and the people who are affected are really convinced that their irrational actions can lead them to victory. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476446 At this point, you will surely have understood t hat the main problem is due to the direct link that the mind associates between action and result. Therefore, it is precisely on this key element that arises the difference in approach between an ordinary person and a professional trader. People who unders tand this problem understand the importance of training their mind about the dissociation from the result. In this way, they develop a new awareness about the result, which allows them to maintain a rational and winning response even in situations where th e result is subject to a random component. The mind of a professional trader In the previous chapter, the cognitive characteristic that distinguishes an ordinary person from a professional trader was identified. This characteristic can be summarized wit h the following concept: \"dissociation from the result\". In other words, it is about breaking the link that our brain creates between action and result. This mental approach is present among professionals from very different sectors; for example, it is nor mal for a professional poker player to get angry when he makes a stupid play and to be happy when he makes an intelligent play, regardless of the outcome of the individual plays. In fact, these players have perfectly understood that there is no direct link between the result of a single operation and the action performed. What makes them successful is always being able to perform a series of rational and correct actions without getting involved in emotions. About this argument, I also report an interesting statement by the professional trader Linda Raschke whose interview was featured in the 06 -2017 issue of Trader Magazine. When asked, \" Is Trading a game for you?\u201d Linda Raschke replies \u201cYes. I barely check the account balance. Because this unnecessarily aff ect me both positively and negatively and does not change the fact that I have to make the right decision again. And if you always make the right decisions, performance becomes simple in the long run\u201d . As you can see, there is such a strong dissociation fr om the single result that she does not even care about its balance (an amateur trader checks his balance every 5 seconds).",

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476447 How meditation can improve our problem -solving skills Andrea Berdondini ABSTRACT : The goal of this article is to try to explain easily, how the practice of meditation affects our problem -solving skills. To do this, I use a mathematical logical method to characterize problems based on the number of their possible solutions. In this way, it easy to explain the two primary approaches that the mind uses in solving problems. The first approach is iterative, optimal in so lving simple problems (problems with a low number of solutions). The second approach is the logical one, optimal in solving complex problems (problems with a high number of solutions). The interesting aspect of these two methods is that their mode of actio n is the opposite. The iterative method is based on action, while the logical method is a reflective approach, in which any unnecessary action takes us away from solving the problem. Consequently, we will see how through the practice of meditation, we can shift our mental predisposition towards the logical approach by inhibiting our propensity for the iterative approach. This is a very important result because it can allow us to improve our ability to solve complex problems. This type of attitude is fundame ntal in a society where technological progress is making all simple and repetitive jobs less indispensable. The two fundamental methods used by the mind in solving problems From a mathematical logical point of view, the problems can be divided according to the number of possible solutions they can have. Therefore, using this approach, we can define two classes of problems: 1) \u201cSimple\u201d problems: the problems in which the space of possible solutions is constituted by a small number of elements. Where the ti me required to try all possible solutions iteratively, is limited and acceptable. Example: a padlock that has 100 possible combinations, if I can try a different combination every 5 seconds, I will try all the combinations in an acceptable time. 2) \u201cComple x\u201d problems: the problems in which the space of possible solutions is constituted by a large number of elements. Where the time to try all possible solutions iteratively, tends to infinity or to an unacceptable time. Example: proving a mathematical theorem , doing it iteratively trying random solutions, takes a time that tends to infinity. Thanks to this classification, we can study, in a simple way, the two fundamental approaches that the mind uses in solving problems. The first approach is iterative, the mind does not try to solve the problem but tries all possible combinations. This approach is the optimal one for solving \u201csimple\u201d problems and was fundamental in the initial part of human evolution. The second approach is the logical one; the mind creates a model of the problem and tries to solve it. This approach is the optimal one for solving \u201ccomplex\u201d problems, and its importance has increased in the course of human evolution. Consequently, this category of problems is also the one that most characterize s our problem -solving skills. Comparing these two methods, the interesting thing we notice is that they act oppositely. The iterative method is based on action, faster I act, faster I solve the problem. Instead, the logic -based Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476448 method is thoughtful; any in correct action takes us away from the solution. To explain the importance of not acting irrationally, when trying to solve a complex problem, I like to give the following example: imagine that you are a hiker who got lost in the jungle, what are you going to do?",

The same thing happens in solving complex proble ms, in which every irrational action is not only useless but it makes us lose energy and time. This example makes us understand how different the two mental approaches are, and how fundamental our mental predisposition is to be successful in situations whe re a type of problem predominates. Another useful point of view, to understand the importance of these two mental approaches, is to comprehend why there is so much interest in algorithms based on artificial intelligence. The reason for such interest stems from the fact that through artificial intelligence the algorithms are moving from an iterative approach to a logical approach. In fact, for example, the software developed to play chess, until recently used iterative approaches. In practice, the software s imulates all possible combinations and chose the best move. This method had two important limitations: it needed a very powerful computer and could not be applied to games like the \u201cgo\u201d in which the possible move combinations are very high. With the advent of artificial intelligence, these virtual players have gone from an iterative approach to a logical approach with incredible results. Google\u2019s Deepmind research team has developed the first software capable of beating the human champion of \u201cgo\u201d, on this t opic I recommend reading the article published on nature \u201cMastering the Game of Go without Human Knowledge\u201d. Now you can understand why the knowledge of these two different mental approaches is fundamental for studying the dynamics that involve our problem -solving skills. Meditation as mental training to improve the problem -solving skills In this section, we will try to explain the implications of meditation on problem -solving skills. The term meditation refers to a large number of techniques, even very d ifferent from each other, whose task is to bring complete awareness of the present moment. One of the oldest and best -known techniques, and consequently among the most practiced, is called vipassana. The practice of this meditation is performed by sitting cross -legged while remaining completely still in a mental state in which we observe everything that happens. Mainly the observation is directed towards thoughts that tend to manifest themselves and towards one\u2019s breathing. If we now analyze the two mental approaches, described in the previous paragraph, it is easy to understand how the practice of this type of meditation tends to be in contrast with the iterative method used in solving problems. As described in the previous paragraph, this approach is based on action, in practice, I act as quickly as possible without ever stopping. Hence, sitting still for no purpose represents the opposite of this method. Consequently, the constant and repeated practice of this type of meditation leads over time to inhibit our propensity to act impulsively. There are many scientific studies on this topic that show how meditation reduces our propensity to multitasking (hyperactivity) and all those irrational and emotional behaviors. This is an important fact because the itera tive approach is based on random (irrational) and continuous actions with a strong emotional component. Meditation in this way modifies our problem -solving skills making us more reflective, Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=399476449 consequently increasing our propensity towards the use of the logi cal approach in solving problems. This result is significant because when we talk about problem -solving we are talking, in most cases, about the ability to solve complex problems. In fact, in a society where technological progress has an exponential trend, our ability to solve problems of this type becomes an increasingly important and requested skill. Another fundamental aspect to keep in mind, regarding the importance of training the mind to a more reflective approach, is to understand the impact that new technologies have on our minds. To answer this question, we need to understand how most of the applications that are used on smartphones, tablets, etc. are developed.",

        "content": "The main purpose of these applications is to create an addiction, and to do this they take advantage of the iterative approach that the mind uses to solve simple problems. This is done because, in this situation, the person is forced to perform a continuou s series of actions, which will correspond to a series of results, the consequence of which is a stimulation of the reward system present in our brain. With this technique, the user of the application will compulsively experience a succession of emotions, the result of which is to create a real addiction. In conclusion, this type of technology is changing the approach to solving the problems of the new generations, favouring the iterative approach over the logical one. For this reason, it is essential to counteract the conditioning caused by these applications with techniques such as meditation, which inhibit our propensity to solve problems iteratively. Conclusion In this article, I have used a simple mathematical logical analysis to relate our problem -solving skills and the practice of meditation. In this way, we find a similarity between two very different realities. On the one hand, we have a scientific formalism, in which through the analysis of a mathematical data the optimal approach is found to sol ve a class of problems. On the other hand, we have meditation, which represents a topic mainly studied in the philosophical field. So we have two extremely distant points of view which, however, as we have seen, tend to have incredibly similar elements of convergence. Indeed, the practice of meditation represents a way of acting contrary to the iterative approach. Consequently, meditation acts by inhibiting our propensity to act iteratively, making us prefer the logical approach, fundamental in solving comp lex problems. We have also seen how modern technologies are influencing new generations to hyperactive and compulsive approaches. So, it becomes essential to contrast this type of mental conditioning, with something that goes to act in the opposite directi on leading us to act more thoughtful. Meditation, from this point of view, can be seen as a practice that acts on some primary aspects used by the mind in many of its processes, such as problem -solving. In this way, we can partly understand why something s o simple has such profound implications in many areas of the brain. For these reasons, I believe that meditation will become an increasingly important formative practice.

We address this concern by investigating whether measures of trading activity propagate volatility. We find no evidence that aggre- gate open interest and trading volume increase volatility. On the contrary, market makers\u2019 inventory gamma is significantly and negatively associated with future intraday volatility.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=46921901 Introduction Trading volume in short-dated options, especially zero-day-to-expiry (0DTE), has exploded in recent years. For the S&P500 index alone, 0DTEs accounted for 50% of the index options volume in August 2023, up from just 5% in 2016.1The major trading hub for equity options, Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe), has sequentially increased the number of weekly index option expiration dates to three in 2016 and five in 2022 to eventually have options that expire every day of the week for the next four weeks, thereby facilitating daily 0DTE option trading. The surge in 0DTE option trading has raised several concerns among market participants and stimulated heated discussions in the press.2The primary concern is that large open posi- tions in 0DTEs and other short-term options may induce delta-hedging that can destabilize the underlying market, even when the underlying instruments are very liquid, as is the case for the S&P500 index-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) SPY and S&P500 E-Mini (ES) Futures.3 The rationale behind these concerns is that if option sellers delta-hedge, they trade in the direction of the return, i.e., sell additional shares of the underlying during a market decline. The intensity with which hedgers need to re-adjust their positions in the underlying is higher for short- maturity options because these options\u2019 delta is more sensitive (measured by \u201cgamma\u201d, which is inversely related to option time to expiry) to changes in the underlying. Thus, if market makers hold large short (negative) inventory during the day and systematically delta-hedge it, sudden market moves will be aggravated by their hedging flows. Cboe, observing the largest trading flows in S&P500 0DTEs, disputes such scenarios, claiming that these flows and the resulting market makers\u2019 exposure during the day are well-balanced and do not pose a danger. Also, when the intraday open interest gamma of market makers is positive, delta-hedging of inventory 1E.g., Volatility Insights: Much Ado About 0DTEs-Evaluating the Market Impact of SPX 0DTE Options. 2See, for example, \u201dSurge in zero-day options sparks fears over market volatility,\u201d or \u201dShort-term investors in SPY and QQQ warned of options risks.\u201d 3Average daily trading volume in these markets in 2023 is around 400 bn USD. 1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190generates trades against the direction of return, potentially dampening future volatility. Hu, Kirilova, and Muravyev (2023) show evidence consistent with the hypothesis that option market makers use active inventory rebalancing in addition to delta-hedging to manage risk, indicating that even when market makers hold short option positions, the underlying asset return shocks may not be intensified by 0DTEs. This paper investigates these contrasting arguments to understand the effects of 0DTE mar- ket growth on the stability of underlying markets.",

        "content": "We show that 0DTEs now dominate index options markets in terms of trading volume, in line with the extant literature (e.g., Almeida, Freire, and Hizmeri 2023, Bandi, Fusari, and Ren` o 2023), but are still relatively smaller than longer-term option markets in terms of open interest, directional exposure, and rebalancing risk. We separately analyze the effects of the potential rebalancing needs resulting from high market makers\u2019 positions, aggregate market open interest, and high trading volume in 0DTEs and other options with expiry dates of up to a month. We reconstruct the intraday open interest in short-term options (less than a month to expiry) by trader types and document that market makers\u2019 open interest gamma is predominantly pos- itive for 0DTEs. Non-professional customers are, on average, the largest sellers of 0DTEs, while the positions of broker-dealers, professional customers, and firms are relatively small. Crucially, we show that the market makers\u2019 intraday open interest gamma for 0DTEs negatively corre- lates with future realized volatility with a moderate economic magnitude. We can interpret this evidence in two ways: If market makers delta-hedge their, on average, positive inventory, they have a volatility-dampening effect, as they trade in the opposite direction of the market, buying in a down-market and selling during a rally. Consistent with this interpretation, we show that the negative correlation is stronger (by a factor of three) on days of important macroeconomic announcements when uncertainty is greater. 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190Our evidence is also broadly consistent with a Kyle (1985) information-based story, where market makers absorb information-driven trades by traders with superior volatility forecasting skills. This scenario is possible if market makers charge a sufficiently high bid-ask spread to offset a partially informed order flow. Indeed, the spreads on 0DTE options are very large. For example, on August 1st, 2024, an at-the-money (ATM) SPY call option was trading with a 0.77% bid-ask spread (one penny minimum tick and a price of $1.30), while in 2021-2023, the average effective spread for S&P500 index options near ATM level was 1.5% (Beckmeyer, Branger, and Gayda 2023). We further analyze how the aggregate dollar gamma of open option positions of different maturities at market open shapes the subsequent intraday underlying index realized volatility unconditionally and conditional on past volatility. We use open interest gamma as a proxy for the aggregate market exposure and show that it did not grow after 2016, either for 0DTEs or the other maturities, suggesting that the 0DTEs market growth is unlikely to have exacerbated the effects of potential delta-hedging activity. Indeed, we do not find evidence that the 0DTEs\u2019 open interest gamma at market open propagates or unconditionally increases the underlying index volatility. For options with one day to two weeks maturity, open interest gamma is associated with lower realized volatility within the day. Next, to understand whether 0DTE option trading volume causes high volatility of the underlying index, we analyze the distribution of intraday returns conditional on large jumps in 0DTE volume and find that it is similar to the distribution conditional on moderate and small changes in volume. To study the integration of the underlying and option markets and shock propagation across the markets, we use a structural vector autoregression framework to analyze joint intraday dynamics of the realized variance, trading volume in the 0DTE options, and trading volume in the underlying index instruments. 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190We find that 0DTEs and underlying markets are rapidly becoming more integrated, with a contemporaneous correlation between intraday trading flows increasing from 0.25-0.30 before 2021 to 0.59 in 2023. Positive shocks to 0DTE trading volume in recent years are associated with and followed by increasingly higher trading volume in the underlying market and vice versa. The observed change in the market structure in recent years also makes the underlying market move stronger with shocks to 0DTE trading volume relative to earlier periods when 0DTE trading was negligible. However, the difference in the magnitude of the average variance response to 0DTE trading across the early and later sample period amounts to only 0.15 standard deviations of the return variance, which is economically negligible.",

        "content": "The strength of the volume shock propagation decreases with time to option maturity, with the effects for all options expiring within the next month driven predominantly by 0- and 1DTEs. While we observe a clear time trend in the average intensity of shock correlation (and resulting propagation) between 0DTE and underlying markets, we do not find supportive evidence that sharp intraday jumps in 0DTE trading propagate past market moves and lead to extreme intraday returns. Our analysis yields some additional insights that are useful for a general understanding of the new and rapidly evolving 0DTEs market. 0DTEs are relatively cheap and do not bear overnight risk. They have extreme leverage close to expiry and demonstrate a very wide distribution of returns. 0DTEs\u2019 high leverage and gamma risk make them good candidates for event-based trading. We assess whether these instruments serve this practical purpose in the market by analyzing the intensity of their use for event-based trading compared to longer maturity options around Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision announcements that are known to be associated with the resolution of uncertainty (see, Cieslak, Morse, and Vissing-Jorgensen 2019, Ai, Han, Pan, and Xu 2022). We show that traders use ultra-short-term options, mainly 0- and 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=46921901DTEs, to bet on the resolution of uncertainty.4Compared to the longer maturity options, the trading volume in the zero- and one-day-to-expiry options significantly declines in the half-hour interval before FOMC announcements and rebounds significantly after the announcement. In recent years, investors have been increasingly selling volatility for yield-enhancing (e.g., Todorov and Vilkov 2024), resulting in net option buying by delta-hedgers. Moreover, anecdotal evidence on the popularity of particular option strategies suggests that retail customers also actively sell volatility using 0DTEs, while market makers, the most active delta hedgers, are net buyers with positive open interest gamma.5Accordingly, the market makers\u2019 positioning in our sample period results in their delta-hedging trades having a significant dampening effect on the underlying volatility instead of the amplification feared by several market participants. Although the pattern suggests no cause for alarm, it is important to note that if market dynamics, regulation, and risk management practices were to encourage market makers to change their strategy and build up a large negative gamma inventory in 0DTEs, their delta-hedging flows can indeed intensify overnight and intraday market jumps, propagating directional moves. We contribute to several strands of research. A quickly increasing number of papers study the patterns in 0DTE options trading (e.g., Beckmeyer, Branger, and Gayda 2023), work on specially designed pricing models for short-term options (e.g., Bandi, Fusari, and Ren` o 2023), and document stylized asset pricing facts related to 0DTEs and other ultra short-term options (e.g., Almeida, Freire, and Hizmeri 2023, Vilkov 2023, Johannes, Kaeck, Seeger, and Shah 2024). Brogaard, Han, and Won (2023) examine the impact of 0DTEs trading on intraday volatility and find that 0DTEs\u2019 relative turnover is positively related to the intraday volatility of the un- derlying. In contrast, our study has a different focus and design. We analyze (i) the rebalancing risks of market makers\u2019 and aggregate open positions in 0DTEs vs. longer-maturity options and 4Johannes, Kaeck, Seeger, and Shah (2024) show similar results for 1DTEs. Londono and Samadi (2024) also use the daily expiration S&P500 index options to document a much larger variance risk premium for options that span key economic data releases than those that do not. 5See, for example, 0DTE Options Strategies: Insights from 25k Trades. 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190their conditional impacts in propagating past realized volatility onto future intraday volatility, and (ii) the conditional intensity of intraday shock propagation between index returns and trad- ing volumes in 0DTEs and underlying markets.6A follow-up paper by Adams, Fontaine, and Ornthanalai (2024) uses the introduction of 0DTE expiration days to confirm that underlying volatility decreases on days with 0DTEs. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to systematically study the effects of gamma exposures in 0DTEs on the underlying variance. We also relate to the empirical literature on the impact of option trading and open interest on the underlying.

Our analysis offers important additional insights because the delta hedging of 0DTE positions have a larger potential for destabilization due to more frequent and larger rebalancing than for longer-term options. Baltussen, Da, Lammers, and Martens (2021) show that past intraday returns predict the last half trading hour returns for various assets. For SPX, the latter is not significantly related to net gamma but is negatively and significantly related to the interaction of net gamma and lagged return. Barbon and Buraschi (2020) study intraday momentum and show that autocorrelations are significantly related to the difference between call and put options\u2019 gamma. J.P.Morgan (2023) reports a stronger intraday mean reversion of returns due to 0DTE flows. Anderegg, Ulmann, and Sornette (2022) suggest that exchange rate volatility significantly increases with the aggregate option gamma, such that delta hedgers\u2019 order flow leads to a 0.7% (0.9%) increase in EUR/USD (USD/JPY) annualized volatility. Sornette, Ulmann, and Wehrli (2022) study Gamestop\u2019s stock price in Spring 2021, noting that as the stock price rose, call option sellers were forced to buy, leading to a price spiral. Lipson, Tomio, and Zhang (2023) 6We compare our results and reconcile some of the differences in our approaches in Section 5. 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190show that shocks to retail option trading due to Robinhood\u2019s introduction of options increased optionable stocks\u2019 return volatility. Our paper also relates to theoretical works (e.g., Jarrow 1994, Frey and Stremme 1997, Frey 1998, Platen and Schweizer 1998) that analyze how options trading and hedging affect the price of the underlying. This literature notes that the hedging demand equals the Black-Scholes net position gamma scaled by time-to-maturity and the options trader\u2019s perceived volatility. Thus, total hedging demand is proportional to the position size by option hedgers, and if option hedgers trade a sufficiently large volume, the stock price volatility explodes as an upward or downward price spiral ensues. We analyze how the potential hedging demand for ultra-short-term options relates to the underlying volatility and how the former is differentially reflected in the pricing of short- and longer-maturity options. We also add to a well-developed literature on index options returns and variance risk pre- miums (e.g., Carr and Wu 2009, Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou 2009, Dew-Becker, Giglio, Le, and Rodriguez 2017, A\u00a8 \u0131t-Sahalia, Karaman, and Mancini 2020, Eraker and Wu 2017). We com- plement these studies by documenting new facts about realized variance risk premiums on the shorter range of maturity spectrum up to 30 days, especially ultra-short-term options expiring within hours instead of days. We show that the magnitude of VRP goes up sharply towards expiry. To our knowledge, our paper is the first to document the negative association between 0DTE open interest gamma and the intraday realized variance risk premium. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the data and definition of risk, return, and trading activity variables. Section 3 presents empirical results that compare aggregate market activity, risks, and returns in 0DTEs to longer maturities. Section 4 analyzes the propagation of volatility by 0DTEs and longer-maturity options\u2019 open interest gammas and looks at the interplay between intraday volatility and trading activity in 0DTEs and underlying markets. Section 5 presents robustness tests and additional analysis, and Section 6 concludes. 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=46921902 Data and Variables Preparation This section summarizes data sources and processing rules in Section 2.1 and variable construc- tion in Section 2.2. 2.1 Data Sources Options.

SPY also had options with three weekly expiration dates for several years and now has the same expiration schedule as SPXW. Currently, Cboe offers options on the S&P500 index and SPY with expiration each day for the next month and some longer maturities. All the considered options have a multiplier m= 100, i.e., the notional of one option contract is given by 100 times the underlying price. As the SPY trades at roughly 1/10th of the SPX, the nominal size of one SPX option contract is roughly ten times that of an SPY contract. For the analysis, we use options with roots SPXW and SPY. We use three source data formats for the options: intraday bars, intraday Cboe open- close volume summary, and actual transactions. 30-minute intraday bars from Cboe DataShop are available from 2012 to 6/2023 and include national best bid and offer (NBBO) with size, 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190open/high/low/close (OHLC) prices and trade volumes, price of the underlying instrument, open interest at the beginning of each day, implied volatilities and selected sensitivities (i.e., Greeks, including delta and gamma).7Open-close volume summary data at 10-minute fre- quency are available from 2021 to 6/2023 for the C1 platform and provide trading volumes for all available option contracts traded on C1, split into aggregate buying and selling flows classi- fied by origin (i.e., trader types including market makers, customers, pro-customers, firms and broker-dealers).8Transactions data from Cboe DataShop are available from 2012 to 6/2023 and represent enhanced data from the Options Price Reporting Authority. It includes trade price and size, the exchange where the trade printed, the NBBO quote and size, the underlying bid- ask, and the implied volatility and the calculated delta of the trade. This data are not cleaned by the provider, and we parse it using filters and procedures similar to Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Sikorskaya (2023).9After the initial parsing, we first aggregate simultaneous trades with the same conditions and then aggregate the data to the 1-minute bars by adding up trade volumes for each 1-minute bar and group, comprised of the expiration date, option type, and strike. We restrict the sample to options on the S&P500 index with the regular (PM) expiration (roots SPXW and SPY), expiring within the next 30 calendar days. We compute for each option on each day its days-to-expiration (DTE), counting only working days (so that an option observed on Friday and expiring on Monday is 1DTE). We compute various market statistics for the options up to 22DTEs and then concentrate in more detail on options with extremely short maturities (0- and 1DTEs). 7On seven dates (24, 26/10, 14/11, and 10, 12, 19, 24/12 of 2018) due to data issues we have zero open interest reported, and we exclude these dates from the analysis. 8Note that all the SPX/SPXW options trading takes place on C1, while SPY options are also traded on other platforms. To reconstruct open interest by trader types one needs to observe all open and close transactions; hence, we exclude SPY root from the analysis of intraday open interest based on the open-close volume data. 9We appreciate having access to the paper replication package at https://tinyurl.com/reppackage, and port the original R code to Python with slight adjustments. We keep the trades with zero canceled trade condition id, positive trade size and trade price , non-negative bid-ask spread spread ,underlying bidweakly larger than 0.01 (vs. 0 .1 in Bryzgalova et al. ), and trade price between best bid - spread and best ask + spread . 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190Underlying Markets.",

We use EOD closing prices of SPX and SPY at 16:00 to compute the final payoff for the available options (we assume that payoff on options with physical exercise can be approximated by the cash settlement at the day close) according to its type. We also compute intraday returns for different time intervals by aggregating 1-minute realized SPX returns.

Futures have a notional of 50 units of the index, and SPY is approximately 1/10 of the index; hence, turnover in SPY and ES corresponds to 10 and 75-100 million units of the index, respectively. Thus, SPY is approximately ten times less liquid than ES, and the latter has the advantage of overnight trading sessions. Anecdotal evidence suggests that delta-hedging of index options happens in both markets, but Minis are preferred by large traders. 10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190where RVon dteis the sum of squared overnight log returns from the close of day duntil expiration corresponding to dte, and RVday dteis the sum of intraday log returns from day d+1 until expiration corresponding to dte.11The weights \u03c9kare determined for each day dfollowing Hansen and Lunde (2005) using an annual rolling window of 251 daily log returns until d\u22121. We compute overnight returns from close at 16:00 on the previous day to open at 9:31 in the morning. Trading Activity and Risk Variables. To analyze the dynamics of market activity and aggregate risks in the option markets, we quantify open interest as both aggregate start-of-day (SOD) open interest reported by the Options Clearing Corporation and intraday open interest by origin (trader types) computed from the Cboe open-close volume summary data at 10-minute frequency, and trading volume computed from both 30-minute bar data or actual transactions (for higher frequency). Volumes and open interest are converted from number of contracts to dollar terms, either dollar notional or dollar sensitivity (option Greeks). Start-of-day dopen interest OId:sod,C for a contract C(combination of underlying instru- ment j, option type cp\u2208 {C(all), P(ut)}, trading days to expiry dte) is in terms of number of open contracts.

The pattern fits well with the intuition that the direction of daily risk in extremely short-term options often changes such that, on average, the dollar deltas net out. On the other hand, flipping (often) the delta of a longer-term option portfolio is costly, and its sign 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190generally corresponds to longer-term market sentiment in a given quarter. 0DTEs\u2019 open interest and dollar gamma are nevertheless high, indicating a non-trivial size of daily directional bets and resulting gamma risk on the market.

Overall, we do not observe any increase in the open interest of 0DTEs following the expo- nential growth in their trading volumes. Since the open interest, not the volume, mainly affects the rebalancing risks of option positions, the observed statistics suggest that it is unlikely that additional sizeable risks stem from 0DTE market growth. Table A1 in the Appendix provides additional summary statistics for options in the other DTE buckets, with an important message: while turnover in the longer-term options has increased far less dramatically than for 0DTEs, at least for options up to a week to expiration, the total directional bets (deltas) and potential gamma risk are similar if not larger compared to options expiring today. 3.2 Trading Activity by Trader Types Market makers are typically considered the trader type that delta-hedge their positions, at least partially (see, Hu 2014, Ni, Pearson, Poteshman, and White 2021). Furthermore, market makers face trading flows from other market participants, and they manage their inventory to keep risks under certain limits.

Figure A1 in the Appendix provides additional figures for options in the other DTE buckets, which confirm that at least in the considered period, market makers are also long gamma in other maturity buckets considered in our analysis, with customers being on the other side of the open interest. 4 0DTE Trading as a Risk Factor 4.1 Variance Propagation Through Gamma Risk We now turn to how the market makers\u2019 intraday open interest gamma relates to the future intraday realized variance, thereby shedding light on the impact of 0DTEs market dynamics on the underlying market. 4.1.1 Intraday Open Interest and Variance A direct causal mechanism through which 0DTEs market dynamics can affect the underlying variance is the market makers\u2019 delta-hedging activity.",

The Greeks are linear operators, so the portfolio delta is just a sum of deltas of options in the portfolio, and we assume aggregate delta right away. To quantify the rebalancing required to maintain a delta-hedged position (ignoring the direct rebalancing of option positions), we use Ito\u2019s Lemma to get the differential change of the portfolio delta: d\u2206 =\u2202\u2206 \u2202SdS+ 0.5\u22022\u2206 \u2202S2(dS)2+\u2202\u2206 \u2202tdt=S\u0393dS S+ 0.5S2\u22022\u2206 \u2202S2\u0012dS S\u00132 +\u2202\u2206 \u2202tdt, so that the change in delta after underlying realized return rt0,t1from t0tot1, in terms of the number of units of underlying, is approximately equal to \u2206t1\u2212\u2206t0\u2248S\u00d7\u0393\u00d7rt0,t1+ 0.5S2\u00d7\u22022\u2206 \u2202S2\u00d7r2 t0,t1+\u2202\u2206 \u2202t(t1\u2212t0), (6) where the first term quantifies the direct gamma effect, the second term quantifies the effect of gamma change, called \u201cspeed,\u201d and the third term quantifies delta time-decay, called \u201ccharm.\u201d For small time intervals it is customary to neglect second-order and time effects, and we also concentrate on the gamma effect in the main analysis.13In dollar terms, the excess portfolio delta to be offset through rebalancing can be approximated as follows: c$\u2206t1\u2248S2\u00d7\u0393\u00d7rt0,t1= $\u0393\u00d7rt0,t1. (7) This expression tells us that a delta-hedger with a positive options portfolio gamma will sell the underlying asset after positive returns and buy it after negative returns, dampening the subsequent volatility. Delta-hedgers with negative gamma will do the opposite, propagating large jumps and thus increasing volatility. In such a scenario, we would observe a negative link between the current level of the delta-hedger\u2019s open interest gamma and future volatility. On the other hand, we would observe no significant association between current open interest gamma 13In the Robustness and Extensions Section 5 we also discuss the effect of speed and charm, and show that including higher-order effects does not affect our conclusion. 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190and future volatility if (i) all traders on both sides of open interest delta-hedge and their trades offset each other, (ii) delta-hedgers maintain gamma levels close to zero and the rebalancing flows are small compared to the underlying market liquidity, and (iii) no traders delta-hedge but instead rebalance their option positions directly. A positive association between open interest gamma of a group of traders and future volatility could arise if these traders are better-informed and adjust their inventory in anticipation of future volatility. Delta-hedging can be very expensive, especially in 0DTEs, because their gamma and the required intensity of rebalancing are increasing sharply on the expiry day. Following Ni et al. (2021), we hypothesize that market makers are the major group of large traders realistically able to delta hedge 0DTEs. At the same time, we also know from Hu, Kirilova, and Muravyev (2023) that market makers could use active inventory rebalancing instead of delta-hedging to manage risk, and in case of short-term options they may be even more inclined to do so.14 To empirically assess whether the intraday patterns of market makers\u2019 inventory in short- term options and subsequent volatility are consistent with any of the outlined scenarios, we regress the 30-minute realized log-variance following every 30-minute intraday interval between 11:00 (so that the intraday lagged variables belong to the same day) and 15:30 on the levels of market makers\u2019 dollar gamma observed at the end of such intervals:15 lnRVt+1=b0+X nbnDTE OI$\u0393 MM,t,nDTE +CX+\u03b5z, (8) where Xis a vector of controls including three lags of dependent variable and three lags of realized 30-minute returns, and time dummies (year, day of week and the end time of each 30-minute intraday bar); all continuous variables are standardized to unit variance for interpretability. 14E.g., J.P.Morgan (2023) reports an increasing liquidation of 0DTE positions and a weaker return mean- reversion towards the end of a day; participants of the Systematic Investor Podcast name direct rebalancing as the preferred channel for 0DTE inventory management, www.toptradersunplugged.com, #275.",

This table reports the results of a regression of log of intraday variance over the 30-minute interval, following every 30-minute intraday time point, on the market maker open interest dollar gamma in SPXW options for different DTEs, denoted OI$\u0393 MM,t,nDTE . The dependent variable and all continuous independent variables are standardized to unit variance. The regression controls for three lags of the dependent variable and of the returns for the same intervals. Standard errors in parentheses use Newey and West (1987) with five lags. The sample period is from 01/2021 to 14/06/2023. The results in Table 2 show that for all the expiry buckets, market makers\u2019 dollar gamma is negatively related to future realized variance, and even with all expiry buckets included in the regression jointly, most of them (except for 11-22 DTE) stay significant and negative. Lagged variance and realized return controls confirm an apparent persistence of realized variance and asymmetric volatility effect. In terms of economic magnitude, columns (2) and (7) indicate a decline in the underlying index variance by 5.2% and 3.7%, respectively, relative to its standard deviation following one standard deviation increase in the market makers\u2019 0DTEs open interest 22 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190gamma. Since market makers\u2019 open interest gamma is predominantly positive for most days and throughout the day in our sample, the coefficient estimates are consistent with market makers\u2019 delta-hedging activities, on average dampening intraday underlying variance, particularly for options with up to two weeks to expiration. Next, we concentrate on 0DTEs and investigate the conditional effects of open interest gamma to ascertain whether the documented unconditional association changes when volatility is high, when current open interest gamma is negative, or whether the effect for negative return realizations is asymmetric. Table 3 shows the estimates of the following regression that includes a conditioning variable to the previous specification: lnRVt+1=b0+OI$\u0393 MM,t, 0DTE\u00d7(b1+b2\u03b8t) +CX+\u03b5z, (9) where \u03b8tis one of the dummy variables, Neg OI$\u0393 MM,t, 0DTEindicating negative market maker\u2019s open interest gamma, High RVtindicating past realized variance above its sample median, and Neg Rettindicating negative 30-minute return of the underlying index. All continuous variables before interaction are standardized to unit variance for interpretability. The interactions of market makers\u2019 0DTEs open interest gamma with dummies for high realized variance and negative realized return, respectively, have positive point estimates but are all insignificant and 2.5-5 times smaller than the base estimate. Thus, high variance and market declines slightly weaken but do not eliminate the volatility-dampening effect of market makers\u2019 0DTEs open interest gamma.",

On the other hand, the positive association conditional on negative inventory gamma is consistent with market makers\u2019 superior volatility timing. To further understand these volatility information stories, we examine whether market makers\u2019 0DTEs open interest gamma changes in response to the prevailing intraday volatility regime. We adapt Ni, Pearson, Poteshman, and White (2021) approach and regress the future level and first difference of market makers\u2019 0DTEs open interest gamma on the underlying variance and returns, separately conditioning onpositive and negative current open interest gamma. If market makers\u2019 inventory gamma changes in response to volatility information, we should observe that these variables, which reflect information about future variance, significantly predict the subsequent market makers\u2019 0DTEs open interest gamma. The results summarized in Table 4 indicate that market makers inventory gamma does not significantly change in response to the intraday volatility information, and a lack of a robust link between negative market makers\u2019 open interest gamma and subsequent variance can stem from any of the reasons we mentioned for the given scenario.",

To check how market makers act in times of elevated uncertainty, we conduct additional analysis that provides further evidence supporting the delta-hedging causal channel. We build on the fact that days with important macroeconomic announcements during regular trading hours are known to feature substantial uncertainty that can pose significant risks to market makers. As such, market makers, which delta-hedge their 0DTEs inventory, are more likely to do so on such high uncertainty days relative to other days.

Using regression (9) with the day-of-announcement dummy as the interaction term (instead of \u03b8t), we compute the total open interest gamma effects (i.e., either the base coefficient or adding up the base and interaction term coefficients). Figure 4 plots these estimates and their confidence intervals. We observe that on the days when market makers face high intraday uncertainty and, hence, have a greater incentive to keep inventory risk under tight control, the negative association between market makers\u2019 open interest gamma and subsequent variance is markedly more negative across the more important releases. 4.1.2 Start-of-Day Open Interest and Daily Variance In this section we analyze the impact of total open interest on subsequent volatility. This is motivated by the possibility that some group of traders, not necessarily just market makers, delta hedge their inventory. One can hypothesize that short gamma positions have a stronger 27 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190motive for maintaining a dynamic hedge because negative convexity leads to losses for short gamma positions in the case of large market moves. We only observe total open interest at the market open. It is not possible to reconstruct intraday total open interest at a higher frequency because the open-close volume data do not contain information about open-close trades that take place between traders of similar category. Nevertheless, we can project future variance onto total 0DTE open interest gamma at the market open to establish whether morning gamma is associated with higher or lower subsequent intraday volatility. For the test we use log realized variance ln RVday dcomputed from equation (2), the start-of- day open interest dollar gamma OI$\u0393 d:sod,dtecomputed from equation (3) and aggregated for the pre-defined DTE buckets and both SPXW and SPY options, to capture total rebalancing risk due to fluctuations in the underlying market index. We estimate the following regression: lnRVday d=b0+OI$\u0393 d:sod,dte\u00d7(b1+b2lnRVon d+b3lnRVday d\u22121) +CX+\u03b5d, (10) where Xis a vector of controls including overnight variance RVon d, five lags of intraday variance RVday d(i.e., lags of the dependent variable), and year dummies.17We standardize all continuous variables before interaction to unit variance. Table 5 provides no indication that total risk in 0DTEs is associated with the propagation of the overnight and lagged intraday variances to the subsequent daily variance. The coefficients on the interaction between the gamma levels and variances are insignificant for 0DTEs. For the other DTE buckets, we have some weak evidence that high gamma and overnight variance interaction terms are linked to a lower variance the next day. Moreover, open interest gamma in the morning of day dis mostly negatively related 17Including more lags of overnight variance has no effect on magnitude and significance of other coefficients, so we kept only one. Excluding the interaction of gamma with lagged intraday variance does not materially change the results. In Robustness Section 5 we also estimate a similar regression without interactions but including lagged daily trading volume in 0DTEs and lagged start-of-day open interest gamma. The volume coefficient turns insignificant once we control for lagged dependent variable. 28 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190lnRVday d 0DTE 1-DTE 2-5 DTE 6-10 DTE 11-22 DTE OI$\u0393 dte,d\u00d7lnRVon d -0.006 -0.036* -0.009 -0.029** -0.039*** (0.015) (0.019) (0.013) (0.014) (0.015) OI$\u0393 dte,d\u00d7lnRVday d\u22121-0.008 -0.013 -0.018 -0.021* 0.000 (0.019) (0.018) (0.013) (0.013) (0.013) OI$\u0393 dte,d-0.176 -0.318* -0.327** -0.451*** -0.195 (0.189) (0.173) (0.138) (0.141) (0.142) lnRVon d 0.066** 0.063** 0.064*** 0.089*** 0.108*** (0.030) (0.030) (0.022) (0.022) (0.024) lnRVday d\u221210.550*** 0.561*** 0.560*** 0.571*** 0.548*** (0.038) (0.035) (0.030) (0.029) (0.030) lnRVday d\u221220.127*** 0.180*** 0.126*** 0.138*** 0.142*** (0.030) (0.032) (0.023) (0.023) (0.024) Year Dummies Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes R-squared Adj. 0.745 0.751 0.726 0.722 0.718 Obs.",

Overall, we do not find evidence that higher open interest gamma levels destabilize prices and contribute to clustered volatility shocks. 4.2 Trading Activity 4.2.1 Intraday Return Dynamics We analyze intraday market returns to assess how sudden spikes in 0DTE trading volume shape subsequent large return realizations. We are interested in the accumulation of realized returns in either the positive or negative direction following a volume jump, with the negative reaction expected to have stronger implications for market stability. While high volume is often associated 29 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190with high return volatility, we want to ascertain whether sharp jumps in 0DTE volume typically precede and potentially cause large underlying returns. To obtain 0DTE options volume, we sum the dollar-delta volumes for SPY and SPXW options at each 1-minute intraday interval and then convert it to log volume v$\u2206 t= lnV ol$\u2206 t. We identify jumps in intraday 0DTE trading volume by point in time twith the 1-minute changes in trading volume ( v$\u2206 t\u2212v$\u2206 t\u22121) larger than three times its standard deviation on a given day. We use the 5-minute cumulative returns (from t+ 1 to t+ 5) as a measure of market reaction to a volume shock at time tand then test whether the market reaction differs conditional on having experienced a sizeable 0DTE volume jump and whether it depends on the realized return before and during the 0DTE trading volume jump. Figure 5 plots the distribution densities of the 5-minute cumulative returns conditional on jump vs. no jump in 0DTEs volume and separately for four sub-periods. Visually, the distribu- tion conditional on volume jumps has slightly fatter tails on both sides of the return realizations, but we do not observe drastic differences in the distributions or out-of-the-ordinary market reac- tion following 0DTE volume jumps. We further test these observations more formally. First, we run two non-parametric tests ( k-sample Anderson-Darling and two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests) to see whether both samples are drawn from the same distribution. Second, because we are especially interested in the tails of the distribution, we run a series of quantile regressions an- alyzing how relatively infrequent realizations of returns depend on 0DTE volume jumps dummy in interaction with year fixed effect and cumulative market returns before the volume jump. Such specification allows us to directly evaluate claims that large underlying market moves are propagated through 0DTE trading, especially in recent years. Table 6 shows the results of the non-parametric tests for the conditional samples. We fail to reject that the samples are drawn from the same distribution for all sub-periods and both tests.",

Standard errors are in parentheses. 4.2.2 Underlying and Options Markets Integration Next, we examine both the underlying and options markets jointly by studying how intraday trading in both markets is related to realized price movements of the underlying asset. To this end, we estimate Vector-Auto-Regressions (VARs) on three key time-series: 0DTE options trad- ing volume, underlying volume, and Realized Variance of the underlying. We seek to understand the joint dynamics of these variables, their contemporaneous correlation, and how the dynamic relationship between them has changed over time as 0DTE trading has become more prevalent. 32 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190Because trading volumes in the underlying and options markets are interrelated and linked to realized returns through delta-hedging, we model their dynamics jointly using a structural VAR. Following Koop, Pesaran, and Potter (1996) and Pesaran and Shin (1998), we analyze responses to shocks in the system using generalized impulse response functions (gIRF), which account for the correlation of structural shocks in the system and are invariant to the ordering of the time-series (Pesaran 2015 and Wiesen and Beaumont 2023). In order to compute volume for the underlying, we use both intraday 1-minute bar data for SPY, and the front-month contract of the S&P500 E-mini Futures, ES. At the one-minute frequency, for each bar within the regular day session (from 9:31 to 16:00), we add up dollar trading volume V$ jfor both j= SPY and ES to obtain aggregate volume V$ d:tand convert it to log v$ d:t= ln V$ d:t. For the volume of 0DTE options, we proceed in the same way, adding dollar delta volumes for each one-minute for SPY and SPXW options and then convert it to log volume v$\u2206 d:t= lnV$\u2206 d:t. We also compute simple SPY returns Rd:tover the matching time intervals and use 1-minute squared returns as the instantaneous variance proxy \u03c32 d:t=R2 d:t. To maintain stationarity in the time-series, we use the first differences of the volume variables for estimation. We also standardize all variables daily to unit variance. Because we want to focus on the variables\u2019 intraday association, we estimate their joint dy- namics each day, compute the generalized impulse response functions, and use the distribution of these gIRFs over a specified period to get the average impulse responses and their confi- dence bounds. We split the sample into two sub-periods: 2012-2019, characterized by relatively less 0DTE volume, and 2020-2023, during which 0DTE trading volumes rapidly increased. As expected, the trading volume differences for 0DTEs and the underlying are highly correlated, especially in the latter period: the correlation goes from 0.27 in 2012-2019 to 0.39 in 2020-2023. The correlations between the variance and volume variables are initially higher for the under- 33 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190lying market than for 0DTEs (0.14 vs. 0.08). However, in the latter period, both correlations almost perfectly align at the level of 0.14\u20130.15. We estimate the following structural model daily as a dynamic reduced-form VAR at 1- minute frequency and using n= 5 lags: \u03c32 d:t=c0+nX l=1c1,l\u2206v$ d:t\u2212l+nX l=1c2,l\u2206v$\u2206 d:t\u2212l+nX l=1c3,l\u03c32 d:t\u2212l+e\u03c32,d:t, \u2206v$\u2206 d:t=b0+nX l=1b1,l\u2206v$ d:t\u2212l+nX l=1b2,l\u2206v$\u2206 d:t\u2212l+nX l=1b3,l\u03c32 d:t\u2212l+e\u2206v$\u2206,d:t, (11) \u2206v$ d:t=a0+nX l=1a1,l\u2206v$ d:t\u2212l+nX l=1a2,l\u2206v$\u2206 d:t\u2212l+nX l=1a3,l\u03c32 d:t\u2212l+e\u2206v$,d:t. We use the estimation output to compute generalized impulse response functions for one- standard deviation shocks to the selected variables.18For each sub-period 2012-2019 and 2020- 2023, we obtain the average values and the confidence bounds (5th and 95th percentiles) from the collection of intraday gIRFs for five time steps.",

To interpret the plots, note that a difference between the two time periods will show as a parallel shift in the gIRFs ifthe change in the gIRF is driven by a contemporaneous cor- 18Note that one can easily extend the analysis to compute joint impulse response functions as in Wiesen and Beaumont (2023). However, it requires an assumption about joint shocks, which adds unnecessary complexity. 34 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190relation. We see this in the last plot (Panel C), where the average post-2020 gIRF is shifted upwards by an amount corresponding to the 0-frequency shift, indicating the response of market variance to shocks in 0DTE volume is entirely driven by an increase in the 0-frequency, con- temporaneous correlation between these variables. We observe no change between the periods for the Variance-to-variance IRF (Panel A). Panel B shows how variance shocks impact 0DTE volume. Here, we see a slight increase at the 0, 1, and 2-minute horizon, followed by a near-zero difference at longer horizons. Figure 6 also shows confidence bands for the gIRFs computed from their empirical distribu- tion. We see that these bands overlap and, thus, suggest that we cannot reject the null that the dynamic relationship implied by the VARs is unchanged from the pre-to post-2020 periods. The point estimates, however, imply a small but statistically insignificant increase in the joint correlation between the three variables at the contemporaneous, 0-frequency horizon. We in- terpret this to suggest an increase in market integration over time. For example, following a one standard deviation shock to 0DTE trading, the underlying index variance rises from about 0.18 standard deviation units in the 2012-2019 sub-period, increasing to 0.26 standard deviation units in 2020-2023. Although these numbers imply a 1.5 times stronger response in the latter period, the magnitude is economically negligible and statistically insignificant. 5 Robustness and Extensions We conduct several tests to assess the robustness of our findings, reconcile some of our results with the existing literature, and collect the additional results in the Online Appendix. We extend our analysis of market maker open interest gamma effect on underlying variance to include \u201cspeed\u201d and \u201ccharm\u201d in Section IA.1.1, and the results indicate that these components do not propagate past volatility or negative market shocks. To test the sensitivity of the results 35 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190for the intraday market maker\u2019s open interest effects on intraday variance, we vary the period for variance computation. Tables IA.2 and IA.3 report the results of the regressions using variances over 10 minute instead of the 30 minutes in the main analysis. The main inferences do not change. We also test the sensitivity of the results for regressions of intraday log variance on the start-of-day open interest gamma and its interactions with overnight and lagged daily variances. Instead of using full-day variance as the dependent variable, we compute intraday variance from 10:00 (the point at which we observe the start of the day open interest gamma) to 14:00 or 12:00. Table IA.4 reports the numbers for the variance between 10:00 and 14:00 (the other time frame is available upon request) and the results are similar to the original table.",

Table IA.6 shows the results of a regression of daily variance on lagged 0DTE volume and open interest gamma, with and without controls for lagged variance. A significant positive coefficient on lagged volume turns insignificant with lagged variance controls. The reported results vary considerably depending on the variables pre-processing and controls (e.g., applying log transformation to the dependent variable, controlling for lags of overnight variance in addition to daily variance, using volume ratio instead of log volume), and because of lack of robustness of such regressions, we would be cautious in interpreting these numbers and their statistical properties. Section IA.1.3 provides additional analysis of sensitivity of impulse response functions to 0DTE market activity in Table IA.7, and also extends the market integration analysis with VAR to longer-term expiry buckets, showing in Figure IA.1 that the increasing correlation of 36 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190intraday volume and variance shocks is driven predominantly by short-term expiry options with less than a week to expiry. In Section IA.1.4, we provide additional results on the returns and variance risk premiums in 0DTE options, and Section IA.1.5 analyzes potential uses of short-term options on days with elevated uncertainty, such as Federal Open Market Committee days. 6 Conclusion Following the introduction of weekly options with daily expiration by Cboe, ultra-short maturity options have surged in popularity in recent years, with the daily trading volume in zero days to expiration options (0DTEs) increasing more than tenfold from its 2012 level. As a result, several large market participants have expressed concerns that the ballooning 0DTE trading could intensify price moves as the re-adjustment of delta hedges in the same direction as the underlying market could amplify price moves. Following the basic causal mechanism from inventory delta-hedging to trading flows and price reaction, we document that market makers\u2019 intraday 0DTE open interest gamma is negatively associated with future short-term volatility. One interpretation of this evidence is that there is a volatility dampening effect arising from market makers\u2019 predominantly long inventory gamma. As a result, market makers trade underlying assets against market shocks when hedging their inventory. The evidence is also consistent with non-market makers trading on information that allows them to time volatility bets. Furthermore, we find no evidence that start-of-day aggregate open interest gamma propagates past daily and overnight volatility unto the future, and for options with one day to two weeks to expiry, it is negatively associated with the subsequent daily volatility. 37 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190We further analyze how spikes in 0DTEs trading volumes shape the subsequent intraday market index returns. We do not find significant differences between distributions on days with and without volume jumps. More so, extreme quantiles of the intraday return distributions are not significantly related to the interaction of 0DTE volume and preceding returns. Nonethe- less, we observe stronger integration of the underlying and 0DTE option markets, with more correlated trading and simultaneous spikes in volumes and return variance. In conclusion, while our results suggest that market makers\u2019 0DTE positions do not propagate large market moves and are linked to a lower, not higher, short-term variance, the results are conditioned on a period when market makers, on average, held long positions in 0DTEs. Thus, while concerns over a potential hedging-based destabilization of underlying markets cannot be substantiated based on our evidence and within our sample period, we do not extrapolate to a scenario where the market makers\u2019 inventories become very negative. Future studies could assess the limitations of the existing 0DTEs regulatory frameworks (e.g., intraday exchange margin and mark-to-market mechanisms) and their potential effect on market stability. Such analysis could yield insights that can aid the design of optimal risk management and regulatory practices, which are beyond the scope of the current study.",

In Section 4.1 we split the delta rebalancing needs into gamma, speed and charm components: \u2206t1\u2212\u2206t0\u2248S\u00d7\u0393\u00d7rt0,t1+ 0.5S2\u00d7\u22022\u2206 \u2202S2\u00d7r2 t0,t1+\u2202\u2206 \u2202t(t1\u2212t0), (IA.1.1) where the first term quantifies the direct gamma effect, the second term quantifies the effect of gamma change, called \u201cspeed,\u201d and the third term quantifies delta time-decay, called \u201ccharm.\u201d For small time intervals it is customary to neglect second-order and time effects, and we also concentrate on the gamma effect in the main analysis. In dollar terms, by multiplying both sides of the equation above by underlying price, the excess portfolio delta to be offset through rebalancing can be approximated as follows: c$\u2206t1\u2248S2\u00d7\u0393\u00d7rt0,t1= $\u0393\u00d7rt0,t1+ 0.5$Speed \u00d7r2 t0,t1+ $Charm \u00d7(t1\u2212t0), (IA.1.2) where we define dollar speed $ Speed =S3\u00d7\u22022\u2206 \u2202S2and dollar charm $ Charm =S\u00d7\u2202\u2206 \u2202t. Empirically, for the 01/2021 to 14/6/2023, for which we can compute the open interest of market makers, both dollar speed and charm are positive on average (and for most days), with charm being very small in magnitude (we compute it for a the 10-minute intraday interval). Being positive, both speed and charm will increase excess delta; in other words, they would increase selling pressure on the market, especially after large intraday return realizations (due to the r2 t0,t1term accompanying dollar speed). For large dollar speed and large negative return realizations, it can propagate intraday volatility in case market maker open interest gamma is small and overcompensated by the dollar speed term.",

The regression controls for three lags of the dependent variable and of the returns computed over the same intervals as the lags of the dependent variable. All the continuous controls are interacted with Neg RettandHigh RVt, but their coefficients are suppressed for brevity. Standard errors are based on Newey and West (1987) with five lags.

The results in Table IA.1 indicate that, on average, the dollar speed has an insignificant effect on the future variance, while charm coefficient is positive and significant, always increasing variance for its positive values. What matters most, however, is that all in- teractions with a negative return dummy are insignificant, so that neither of the excess open interest delta components contribute to the \u201cbad\u201d variance propagation. Interaction of speed with high variance dummy is even negative with borderline significance, thus linked to lower future variance when variance is high at the moment. Intraday Market Maker Open Interest Gamma Effects: Variance Period Variations. To test the sensitivity of the results for the intraday market maker\u2019s open interest gamma effects on intraday variance, reported in Tables 2 and 3, we vary the period for intraday variance computation. In Tables IA.2 and IA.3 we report the results of the regressions using 10-minute intraday variances instead of the 30-minute variances in the main analysis, stressing this way a more short-term gamma effect. A few coefficients change slightly, but the magnitude and significance of the main effects are similar, leading us to the same conclusions as in the main text. The only significant change happens to the negative gamma effect in Table IA.3\u2014it is still positive, but loses significance: The total effects are 0.012 and 0.034 in columns (1) and (2), with t-stats of 0.37 and 1.14, respectively. When market makers are net short in 0DTEs, their open interest does not significantly affects the subsequent short-term realized variance. Start of Day Aggregate Open Interest Gamma Effects: Variance Period Variations. We also test sensitivity of the results reported in Table 5, in which we regress intraday log variance on the start-of-day open interest gamma and its interactions with overnight and lagged daily variances.",

To ascertain the special features of 0DTEs, we first look at the average variance risk premium priced into these options and compare it to the other DTE buckets.

A high realized variance risk premium is either rational, i.e., can be justified by higher risks of ultra-short-term options, or irrational, not stemming from higher risks on investment but rather from forces like sentiment or market microstructure factors. However, it seems intuitive that 0DTE options are riskier than the longer-term ones given that option risk tends to increase closer to expiration time: (i) they are cheaper for a unit of directional bet and provide higher leverage; (ii) they have higher gamma risk, which increases exponentially closer to expiration for near at-the-money options; (iii) they are exposed to pin risk; and (iv) they experience an increasing time decay closer to expiration. Figure IA.3 shows average annualized VRPs until expiration time (16:00) computed at the end of each 30-minute bar during the day.

The figure shows average variance risk premiums (VRP) for SPXW options by intraday 30-minute points for 0DTEs. VRP is computed as implied minus realized variances to expiration at 16:00 annualized using exact minutes to expiration and 365 \u00d724\u00d760 minutes per day. We use only 0DTE options and average realized VRPs from the end of each bar to expiration at 16:00 that day (with 95% confidence bounds based on Newey and West (1987) standard errors with one lag). The sample period is from 01/2012 to 14/06/2023. To further understand whether the variance risk premium is linked to (or justified by) the risk of investment in options just hours (or minutes) before expiration, we analyze the dynamics of option investment performance at various points during the expiration day. At the end of each 30-minute bar, we select two calls, two puts, and two straddles with strike prices just around the 14 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190current SPX level to be approximately ATM. Straddles are then close to being delta-neutral and call and put options close to 0 .5 and \u22120.5 deltas, respectively. We compute the payoffs of these option positions using the SPX level at market close at 16:00 and then the realized return using the mid-prices at the end of the respective bar and the computed payoffs. We scale the returns to annual terms using the exact number of minutes to expiration and 60 \u00d724\u00d7365 minutes per year. These realized returns are used to compute performance statistics (means, quartiles, and standard deviations of the distribution) for calls, puts, straddles, and all strategies combined in Figure IA.4 and for straddles in more detail in Table IA.9. We observe that all the strategies reap negative returns on average, with the distribution being extremely wide and right-skewed, especially later in the day. Most importantly, the volatility of realized returns increases faster closer to expiration and jumps by a factor of 2 in the last bar. Average returns of the delta-neutral straddles, i.e., strategies closest to the pure volatility trade, are all negative and rapidly increasing in absolute value to the end of the day. In fact, the average return is an order of magnitude larger in the last to-expiration bar compared to the noon. Table IA.9 shows that the risks for the delta-neutral straddles increase more or less pro- portionally to the expected returns. For all time points in the afternoon, the Sharpe ratios of investing into straddles are in the same ballpark. Because realized return distributions are very noisy and right-skewed, the Sharpe ratio may not be the best measure of risk-return trade-off. Nevertheless, combined with the pronounced return skewness, it follows that the increase in realized VRPs during the day we observed earlier closely tracks the dynamics of realized risks in terms of variance of returns.",

IA.1.5 Real Uses of 0DTEs: Short-term Bets Our results so far indicate that 0DTEs do not stand out from other longer maturity options on the basis of their market-destabilizing effect. Instead, 0DTEs stand out mainly based on their extremely high ex-post variance risk premium, especially in the last hours before expiration, which we link to the convexly increasing leverage, gamma risk, and the speed of time decay of 0DTEs shortly before expiration. Maximum payoffs from the ATM straddles in Table IA.9 are truly stunning, and even though mean (and median) returns are increasingly negative and volatile, many retail investors may be attracted by the lottery characteristics of the payoffs.

Coefficients b1andb2capture the average change in options trading activity (in billions of dollars per 30-minute bar) before and after FOMC announcements, respectively, relative to other intraday periods not adjacent to FOMC announcements and accounting for various time-fixed effects captured by X, namely year, month, day of the week, and time of day effects. We group the time of the day into three buckets, morning, afternoon and evening, and then use these buckets in the controls. 0DTE 1 DTE 2-5 DTE 6-10 DTE 11-22 DTE2 1 012Change in trade_volume_delta_usd Around FOMC Announcement; FE: All 1 hr before FOMC After FOMC Figure IA.5: Option Trading Volume Around FOMC Announcement by DTE. This Figure reports the coefficient estimates and the 95% confidence bounds from regressing dollar delta volume (in billions) at a 30-minute frequency on indicator variables for periods around FOMC announcements, as specified in equation (IA.1.8). We estimate the regression separately for the different DTE buckets on the x-axis. Confidence bounds are based on Newey and West (1987) standard errors with five lags. The sample period is from 01/2012 to 14/06/2023. Figure IA.5 shows that options in all DTE buckets experience a significant reduction in trading volume before the FOMC decision and an almost symmetric increase in activity after the announcement.

The sample period is from 01/2012 to 14/06/2023. Second, we run a similar regression for the realized variance risk premiums by using the realized variance risk premium for each 30-minute bar d:tdefined in equation (IA.1.6) for a DTE bucket dte(i.e., V RP$\u2206 dte,d :t,30m) on the left-hand side of equation (IA.1.8). Figure IA.6 shows that the realized VRPs before the FOMC are all close to zero and insignificant. It indicates stable prices before an announcement, i.e., changes in implied variances over the period are almost perfectly matched with the realized variance.",

Thus, trading in short-term options around FOMC announcements is akin to betting on the resolution of short-term uncertainty: one builds up and keeps short volatility positions in times of elevated uncertainty, and hence, high ex-ante variance risk premium (e.g., Bali and Zhou 2016), and liquidates them after the uncertainty is resolved and prices settle down. The other side, the option buyers, are betting on (or hedging) a directional market move after the FOMC decision at a high relative price but still cheaper in absolute terms compared to using longer-term options. Longer-term options, with maturities exceeding one day, retain much of their value beyond the period influenced by FOMC-related uncertainty, and their premiums are 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190not significantly eroded by time decay yet.

India\u2019s macroeconomic parameters look healthy in the long term inspite of a temporary blip in its growth figures on account of a slew of structural reforms, such as implementation of GST, RERA, new insolvency and bankruptcy code and demonetisation leading to formalization of Indian economy. With the recent steps such as recapitalization of banks, the economy is all set to follow a northward trajectory in the coming years. As more sectors come under t he fold of formal economy, asset allocation is witnessing a structural shift with financial assets gaining an upper hand over physical assets. In 2017 , total wealth grew by 10.91% to reach `344 lakh crore. The wealth in financial assets held by individuals grew substantially by 14.63%, while it grew by 5.92% in physical assets showing a trend reversal from 2016 (Karvy's India Wealth Report 2017) In fac t, millennials are entering their prime earning years and also have the prospect of large inheritances.",

It is often a cost-effective way of getting a good performance assessment. We show that individuals trading in the stock market also evaluate their performance by counting the number of wins, but this produces an upward-biased performance measure. Ourfindingsrevealakeydriverofthewell-documentedoverconfidenceamong individuals actively trading in the stock market. Our dataset includes all trading activity of all Brazilian retail day traders from 2012 to 2018. Day trading1is particularly useful for studying the role of counting heuris- tics in inferring trading skills for two reasons. First, the vast majority of individuals lose money day trading \u2013 97%of all individuals in this dataset who day-traded for more than 300 days lost money after trading costs were considered (Chague, De-Losso, and Giovannetti, 2019). Therefore, quitting day trading is an observable behavior of effective self-assessment and learning regarding own trading ability. Second, day trad- ing yields a data point every trading day. Hence, we can accurately identify the date individuals quit (their last day of day trade). We first show that decisions to continue or quit day trading are based on a simple counting heuristic, the proportion of profitable days. Controlling for this, actual finan- cial results do not seem to matter. We then show that this heuristic induces individuals to be overconfident: owing to the disposition effect, average daily losses are substan- tially larger than average daily gains, implying that the simple number of successes is an upward-biased performance measure. We focus our baseline analyses on 39,744 individuals who began to day-trade during our sample period, did so for at least 30 trading days, and eventually quit day-trading. 1A day trade consists of buying and selling the same amount of the same instrument (e.g., a stock or a futures contract) within a single trading day. 2We study their quitting decisions. We start by showing that the probability of an individual quitting day trading on a given day is a discontinuous function of the result obtained on that day, with a large jump at zero. Losing 100 dollars or 10 dollars predicts the same probability of quitting (about 7%, when we focus on each individual\u2019s last 20 trading days). In turn, winning 10 dollars or 100 dollars predicts a much lower probability of quitting (about 3%). That is, the quitting decision depends not on the amount the individual wins or loses on the day but simply on whether the result is positive or negative. If winning or losing (any amount) is what predicts quitting, it seems individuals simply count wins to infer their skill. To confirm this, we run panel regressions, mod- eling the decision to quit day trading on a given day as a function of cumulative past performance.",

        "content": "We control for individual-level fixed effects to take into account omitted variables at the individual level that can affect the quitting decision (such as income, overall trading skill, and IQ). We confirm that the proportion of profitable days, not the total financial result, explains quitting. An increase of 10 percentage points in the proportion of profitable days reduces the probability of quitting by 0.58 percentage points (a large effect given that the unconditional probability of quitting is 1.29%). We run a number of robustness exercises, such as focusing only on futures contract day-trading,2examining the number of days until the next day-trade as an alternative outcome variable to quitting, and exploring different ways of identifying the first and last day trades. Results remain consistent. Accurately assessing the performance of financial portfolios is challenging, requiring the computation of a time series of portfolio returns and its regression on a set of well- chosen risk factors to obtain the portfolio alpha. In contrast, calculating a nearly 2In futures trading, all trades must be settled at the end of the day as settlement occurs daily in the futures market, unlike in equity trading where an individual might decide to roll the paper gain or loss to the next day. 3perfect measure of day-trading performance is simple: one only needs to sum up daily day-trading financial results. Therefore, our finding that individuals assess their day- trading performance by counting wins is particularly surprising. This simple counting heuristic would not be problematic if the proportion of prof- itable days were an unbiased measure of day-trading overall performance. We then show this is not the case. The distribution of individuals\u2019 daily results is highly skewed to the left. Day traders do have more profitable days than losing days. However, average daily losses are larger than average daily gains, and their overall result is negative. Indeed, the 39,744 individuals profited on most days they traded (52.3%) but, at the same time, had a total gross loss in excess of 100 million dollars.3The proportion of profitable days gives individuals a false impression of good trading performance. A possible explanation for the left-skewed distribution of daily profits is the well- knowndispositioneffect(ShefrinandStatman,1985,Odean,1998,WeberandCamerer, 1998). This behavioral bias has been shown to affect individual investors in several countries, for some groups of professional investors, different types of assets (see the survey in Barber and Odean, 2013), and also for day traders (see Linnainmaa, 2003, Linnainmaa,2005,JordanandDiltz,2003,andHeimer,2016). Owingtothedisposition effect, a day trader who starts the day winning will be inclined to close the position and call it a day but, when facing losses, will tend to persist in trading during that day, trying to recover. Doing so artificially increases the frequency of profitable days at the expense of larger daily financial losses when they occur. We show that asymmetric day-trading results are related to the disposition effect by analyzing a subsample of day traders for whom we observe their entire intraday trading activity, deal by deal. For 3,980 individuals, representing a random sample of 3Considering trading costs, taxes, and expenses on trading courses, trading losses would be even larger. 410% of our population of day traders, we have a granular dataset with complete records of all their day-trading deals. There are 13,130,771 deals in this dataset. Using these deal-by-deal data we show that: individuals display a strong disposition effect when day-trading; individuals with a stronger disposition effect also display a higher proportion of profitable days and more skewed daily results; the disposition effect increases over time as individuals continue day-trading, progressively inflating the proportion of profitable days; and individuals\u2019 actual trading skill does not increase over time. Finally, we develop and estimate a model to infer the counterfactual proportion of profitable days among day traders if they displayed no disposition effect. In the model, a day is divided into two trading sessions. During session 1, an individual makes a bet. If the result is positive, they call it a day, but if it is negative, they place another bet. The size of the second bet is the absolute value of the loss of the first session times a parameter \u03b1. The parameter \u03b1captures the day traders\u2019 propensity for the disposition effect.",

        "content": "The case \u03b1= 0implies no disposition effect and a symmetric distribution of gains. A larger \u03b1leads to higher odds of wins in a day and higher skewness. We estimate the model parameters by GMM targeting the key moments describing traders\u2019performance: theaverage, variance, andskewnessoftheirresults, aswellasthe proportion of winning days. Our estimates indicate that the proportion of profitable days in the absence of the disposition effect would be 46.7%, significantly below the observednumberof 52.3%. Usingourdeal-by-dealdataset, weconfirmthatindividuals\u2019 actual day-trading skill is indeed below 50%. We also employ the model to understand whether \u03b1changes over time as an indi- vidual continues to day-trade. We restrict our sample to individuals who decided to day-trade for more than 250 days before quitting and estimate the model\u2019s parameters for different time intervals. We find that \u03b1increases as individuals continue to day- 5trade, so the distribution of daily results becomes even more left-skewed with time. Because of that, while the estimated actual skill is roughly constant at around 47% over time, the odds of positive profits on a given day rise with time (from 51.5% to 56.7%). As individuals persist in day trading, their behavior artificially inflates the simple counting heuristic. Perhaps surprisingly, the reluctance to accept losses on a single day actually grows with trading experience. Our paper is closely related to G\u00f6dker, Odean, and Smeets (2023), although their research environment and methodology are very different from ours. First, they ana- lyze a survey of retail investors from a Dutch financial institution and show that the disposition effect correlates with overconfidence among individuals. Then, using an online experiment, they find a causal effect of the disposition effect on overconfidence. Our paper is also related to the findings of Ungeheuer and Weber (2021) and Unge- heuer and Weber (2023). Ungeheuer and Weber (2021) conduct four laboratory ex- periments to explore how correlations across stocks are perceived. They find that individuals base their decisions on a simple heuristic: counting the number of times stocks move in the same direction. Ungeheuer and Weber (2023) show that individuals also seem to rely on frequencies to determine which assets are likely to outperform. Through lab experiments, they find that stocks which more frequently outperform others are more likely to be selected by participants, even though these stocks are first-order stochastically dominated by assets that underperform frequently.

Ifretailinvestorsareoverconfidentabouttheirabilitiesduetoerrorsinevaluat- ing their trading performance, as we show, there is potential for welfare improvement. Regulators might need to worry about providing better information to individuals. Our paper also relates to a recent literature on belief updating, specifically on why people make errors when updating beliefs based on noisy signals. Bordalo et al. (2023) argue that individuals might focus on certain salient features of a problem, neglecting non-salient but equally important ones. In our context, the salient feature that day traders consider is the winning frequency, which is an easy measure to recall. Ba, Bohren, and Imas (2023) model belief updating as a two-stage process where people first simplify the information structure of the problem they face, and then form beliefs that might be subject to errors. They find that noisier signals lead to overreaction. Augenblick, Lazarus, and Thaler (2024) find that while individuals might agree on the direction of the belief update, they tend to overreact to weak signals and underreact to strong ones. To the extent that the magnitude of day-trading results indicates the strength of the signal, our findings are consistent with day traders underreacting to strong signals and overreacting to weak signals, as both very negative results and close-to-zero results predict the same quitting likelihood.",

Investors forgetting their losses (Ben-David, Birru, and Prokopenya 2018, and G\u00f6dker, Jiao, and Smeets 2024), or using upward-biased heuristic to compute their performance (as shown by us) could be complementary explanations. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our dataset. Section 3 shows that individuals\u2019 decisions to continue day-trading are explained by their proportion of profitable days. Section 4 shows that the proportion of profitable days is an upward-biased measure of day-trading performance, inflated by the disposi- tion effect, and presents a model to estimate the actual skill of day traders from daily results. Section 5 concludes. 2 Data The dataset come from CVM (Comiss\u00e3o de Valores Mobili\u00e1rios), the Brazilian SEC, and spans 2012 to 2018. It is at the investor-day level and contains the day-trading grossprofit(excludingalltransactioncosts)forallindividualswhoday-tradedinBrazil. We define a day trade as the trade activity during a day when the individual buys and sells the same amount of an asset (the gross profit is then the total revenues from sales minus the expenses from purchases). We compute the day-trading gross profit of each individual on each day as their aggregate gross profit across their day- trading activity in stocks (all stocks listed in the Brazilian stock exchange) and two future contracts very popular among individuals who day-trade: mini-\u00edndice (mini- index) and mini-d\u00f3lar (mini-dollar).4For each pair individual-day, we observe an 4Day traders operating mini-index try to predict intraday variations in the stock market index (Ibovespa). In turn, day traders operating mini-dollar try to forecast intraday variations in the exchange rate between dollars and Brazilian reais. These future contracts allow individuals to day- trade using massive leverage, about 400 times the value deposited with the broker, a feature that 8anonymous identification variable for the individual that remains constant over time, and we compute their total day-trading gross profit (across mini-index, mini-dollar, and stocks). We use the first year of our dataset, 2012, to identify each individual\u2019s first day of day-trade. We say an individual began to day-trade on a given day if we see no day-trading activity from them before that day and discard anyone who day-traded in 2012 from the sample. We observe 241,452 individuals beginning to day-trade from 2013 to 2018. Out of these, 50,536 individuals day-traded for more than 30 trading days \u2014 a minimum level of persistence to be considered in our baseline analysis. Moreover, since our primary goal is to study when and why individuals quit day-trading, in our baseline analysis, we exclude individuals who have day-traded in the last two months of our sample (November and December 2018) \u2013 for whom our sample may be censored. We end up with 39,744 individuals who began to day-trade between 2013 and 2018, day-traded for more than 30 days, and eventually quit day-trading.5 Afirst-passanalysisofthedatashowsanintriguingrelationbetweenhowmanydays individuals day-traded before quitting, the proportion of days with a positive result, and their total profits.

[Table 1 about here] The table shows that 48% of the 39,744 individuals presented positive gross results in more than 50% of the days, but, at the same time, only 20% of them had a total positive gross result. These seemingly contradictory facts come from the distribution of daily results being highly skewed to the left, as we will discuss ahead. The table also shows that, as a group, the 39,744 individuals profited on most days they traded (52.3%) but, at the same time, had a total gross result of -105.8 million dollars.6 Interestingly, Table 1 also shows that groups comprising individuals who traded more show, on average, a higher fraction of individuals with Prop > 50%(Column 5) but a lower fraction of individuals with a positive total result (Column 4). Do individuals look at the proportion of profitable days (and not at the total financial result) to infer their performance and decide to continue or quit day-trading? We answer this question in the next section. 3 Deciding to quit day-trading It is well-known that individuals in general lose by day-trading \u2014 see Linnainmaa (2003, 2005), Jordan and Diltz (2003), Choe and Eom (2009), Ryu (2012), Kuo and Lin(2013),andBarberetal.(2020). Accordingto(Chague,De-Losso,andGiovannetti, 2019), 97%of all individuals in our dataset who day-traded for more than 300 days lost money after trading costs were considered. Hence, there is a clear observable behavior 6The average loss per person is 2.7 thousand dollars, similar to the Brazilian quarterly income per capita. 10that reflects individuals\u2019 effective learning about their own day-trading skill: quitting day-trading. This section presents evidence that individuals\u2019 decisions to quit or continue day- trading are explained by an incomplete measure of their trading performance: the simple proportion of days with a positive result. We first show that the probability of a day being an individual\u2019s last day-trading session is a discontinuous function of the result obtained on that day with a large jump at zero. We initially focus on the last 20 days of day-trading of the 39,744individuals who traded for at least 30 days (a total of 794,880 individual-day observations). By doing so, the sample becomes balanced across individuals.7 Foreachindividual-daywehavethegrossresultobtainedfromday-trading, Result i,t, which is computed in dollars.8We define Quit i,t= 1if day tis individual\u2019s ilast day of day-trading and Quit i,t= 0for the 19 days preceding the last one. We want to estimate the probability of Quit i,t= 1as a function of Result i,t. To do this, we separate the individual-day observations into bins relative to Result i,tand compute the average of Quit i,tand its 95% confidence band within each bin. We define 20 ten-dollar bins around zero: from -$100 to -$90, -$90 to -$80, ..., +$80 to +$90, and +$90 to +$100 ( Result i,tis between -$100 and +$100 in 76% of the 794,880 individual-day observations). Figure 1 presents the result. [Figure 1 about here] Figure 1 shows the probability of Quit i,t= 1is a discontinuous function of Result i,t. Since winning or losing a dollar reveals virtually the same information about an indi- vidual\u2019s ability, this discontinuity would not be expected in a world of Bayesian agents 7Results are very robust to changes in the time window. 8We use the average exchange rate in the period, 3.02reais per dollar. 11with no limits to processing information.9 Interestingly, the discontinuity at zero dwarfs any other effect on quitting. Whether an individual obtains a positive or a negative result on a given day determines the decision to continue or quit day-trading. The amount won or lost does not seem to matter. The probability of a day with a small loss (up to -$10) being their last day of day-trade, considering their previous 20 days, is about 7.0%.",

        "content": "In turn, the probability of a day with a small gain (up to +$10) being their last day of day trade is about 4.0%. Since results are gross, the first bin on the gains region may actually also include negative net results. If we ignore this first bin and, instead, look at the second one (positive gross results from +$10 to +$20), the probability of quitting falls below 3.0%. Figure 1 points to the sheer proportion of days with a positive result as the key statistic to explain quitting behavior. To confirm this, we estimate the following panel regression, using all individual-day observations starting on the 31st day of day trade of each individual (the first day we may observe quitting in the sample since the 39,744 individuals day-traded for at least 30 trading days): Quit i,t=\u03b21TotResult i,t+\u03b22Prop i,t+\u00b5i+\u03b3t+\u03f5i,t (1) where Quit i,tis equal to 1 if tis the last day of day trade of individual iand zero otherwise, TotResult i,tis the total financial gross result of individual ifrom day 1 to dayt(in thousands of dollars), Prop i,tis the proportion of days with a positive gross resultfrom day 1today t,\u00b5iareindividual fixed-effects(aconstantforeachindividual) and\u03b3tare day-trading days fixed-effects (a constant for the 31st day of day trade of each individual, another for the 32nd, and so on). 9Interestingly, Ben-David, Birru, and Prokopenya (2018) also document discontinuities around zero returns when examining the effects of past-week performance of Forex day traders on future risk-taking measures such as trade size and the number of trades. 12By employing trading days fixed-effects, we are estimating, for a given trading day (for instance, the 50th), the chances of an individual quitting day-trading on that specific trading day \u2013 across all individuals who have persisted until that day (at least). If individuals look at their total financial result until that day to decide to quit or continue day-trading, we should find \u03b21negative and significant. If individuals look at their proportion of days with a positive result until that day, we should find \u03b22 negative and significant. Importantly, by including individual fixed effects, we consider omitted variables at the individual level that can affect the quitting decision, such as income, overall trading skill, IQ, etc. Table 2 presents the estimates of equation 1. [Table 2 about here] Table 2 shows that the coefficient on individuals\u2019 cumulative result is statistically significant only when we do not control for the proportion of wins. As shown in column 3, whatreallymattersistheproportionofdaystheyhavegotapositivegrossresult. An increase of 10 percentage points in this proportion decreases the probability of quitting in 0.58 percentage point (a large effect given that the average of Quitis1.29%). 3.1 Intensive margin: Number of days until next day trade In Table 2, the dependent variable Quit i,tis equal to 1 if tis the last day of day trade of individual iand zero otherwise. We could perceive this as an extensive margin of individuals behavior, while the intensive margin would be the number of days until the next day of day trade. If we consider this intensive margin as the dependent variable of regression (1), we also find that the sheer proportion of profitable days, and not the actual financial result, explains individuals behavior. This is shown in Table 3. 13[Table 3 about here] Column 3 of Table 3 shows that an individual with a larger proportion of profitable days until twill day-trade again sooner. In turn, their actual financial result until day tdoes not explain NumDays i,tonce we controll for Prop i,t. 3.2 Recent vs. former proportion of profitable days In Tables 2 and 3, we compute the proportion of profitable days of individual ifrom their first day of day trade until day t. We now show that the recent proportion of profitable days is more important to explain individuals quitting behavior than a proportion computed with days further in the past. We estimate Quit i,t=\u03b21RecentProp i,t+\u03b22FormerProp i,t+\u00b5i+\u03b3t+\u03f5i,t (2) where RecentProp i,tis the proportion of days with a positive gross result from day t\u22129to day t, i.e., considering the last 10 days of day trade, and FormerProp i,tis the proportion of days with a positive gross result from day t\u221219to day t\u221210, i.e., considering the 10 days before.

        "content": "[Table 4 about here] As shown in column 3 of Table 4, both recent and former proportions of profitable days explain quitting decision. However, the coefficient on the recent proportion is about 10 times larger. This is consistent with the recent proportion being easier to be recalled by individuals. 143.3 Who looks at the proportion of profitable days? Among the 39,970 individuals in our sample, 90% are males, the average age is 36 (median 34), and the median number of different stocks they have purchased (not day- traded) during our sample period is 8 (10,585 individuals have only day-traded, i.e., have purchased no stock). To understand whether the quitting behavior varies across different groups of indi- viduals, we estimate regression (1) separated for males and females, individuals above and below the median age, and individuals above and below the median number of stocks purchased. Table 5 presents the results. [Table 5 about here] AccordingtoTable5, theproportionofprofitabledaysexplainsindividual\u2019squitting decisionforallgroupsofindividuals. However, forwomen, youngerandmorediversified individuals, the coefficient of TotResult is also statistically significant, indicating that these individuals also look at their actual financial result when deciding to quit day- trading. 3.4 Robustness Day-trading profits are likely to be upward-biased in the case of stocks. This is because some stock purchases that were not supposed to be day trades will appear as profitable day trades in our sample. Due to the disposition effect, individuals who bought an asset with the intention of holding it are more likely to close the position on the same day if the stock price rises hours after the purchase. Although this would generate an upward bias in the performance measures for day-trading stocks, it is unclear how this would bias our conclusion that individuals\u2019 15decisions to continue day-trading are explained by the proportion of profitable days and not by their actual overall financial result. Nonetheless, we now show that this conclusion remains the same if we consider only day-trading in future contracts, where the issue is not relevant. In the context of day-trading futures contracts, leveraging far exceeds the trader\u2019s actual capital, often surpassing 400 times the amount deposited in the brokerage house. Actually, thisiswhatattractsindividualstoday-tradefuturecontracts\u2014forthe39,744 individuals in our main sample, 80.4% of their day trades are in future contracts, and 19.6% are in stocks. The leverage in future contracts implies that individuals cannot carry positions overnight. Hence, the vast majority of trades in future contracts should indeed be day trades from the start. Table 6 shows results when compute day traders\u2019 daily results in future contracts only. The estimates are very similar to those in Table 2. [Table 6 about here] As an additional robustness analysis we consider a more restrictive filter for the selected individuals. We use 2012, 2013, and 2014 to identify the first day of day trade. Thatis, wesayanindividualbegantoday-tradeonagivendayof2015orlaterifwesee no day-trading activity from them before that day. Moreover we exclude individuals who have day-traded any time 2018 to define the last day of day trade.10We end up with 23,428 individuals. Estimates are again similar to those in Table 2, as shown in Table 7. 10As described in Section 2, our original dataset goes from 2012 to 2018 and we say an individual began to day-trade on a given day of 2013 or later if we see no day-trading activity from them before that day. That is, we use the year of 2012 to identifying the first day individuals day-trade. Moreover, also as described in Section 2, we exclude individuals who have day-traded in the last two months of our sample (November and December 2018), for whom our sample may be censored, i.e., the last day of day trade that we observe may not be really the last. 16[Table 7 about here] 4 Disposition effect and asymmetric daily results Theprevioussectionshowsthatindividuals\u2019decisionstoquitday-tradingareexplained mainly by their simple proportion of days with a positive result, not by their actual total financial result. We now show that the proportion of winning days is a biased measure of day-trading performance. First, we show that the distribution of individuals\u2019 daily results is highly skewed to the left. Day traders have more winning days than losing days. However, since their daily losses are larger than their daily gains, they display a negative overall result.",

First, we use intraday data available for a subsample of individuals. Second, we develop a stylized model of a trading day that allows us to estimate agents\u2019 trading skills and disposition effects from data on daily results. 4.1 Asymmetric daily results For most individuals, daily losses are larger than daily gains; the distribution of daily results is skewed to the left. As such, even though Prop > 50%, day-trading can lead to an overall financial loss. Thedistributionof Result i,tacrossallindividual-dayobservationsisindeedstrongly negatively skewed. It has an average of -24 dollars and a median of 2 dollars; the 1st percentile is \u22121,589dollars while the 99th percentile is 1,112dollars, and the 5th percentile is \u2212359dollars while the 95th percentile is 310dollars. However, sincedifferentindividualstradedifferentvolumes, evaluatingtheskewness ofResult i,tis not ideal. We then create a standardized measure for Result i,t, called 17StdResult i,t, which is given by Result i,tdivided by the average of the absolute value of Result i,tduring the previous 30 days of day trade for individual i. The interpretation ofStdResult i,tis straightforward: if StdResult i,t= 2, individual iwon on day ta value that is two times the average value he has been winning or losing in the recent past; if StdResult i,t=\u22122, he lost on day ta value that is two times the average value he has been winning or losing in the recent past. The skewness of StdResult is also negative. It has an average of \u22120.2and median of0.05, the 1st percentile is \u22126.9while the 99th percentile is 3.8, and the 5th percentile is\u22122.9while the 95th percentile is 1.9. It is also illustrative to compute the skewness of Resultwithin each individual and evaluate its distribution. Accordingly, Figure 2 plots the distribution across individuals of the skewness of their gross daily results. Out of the 39,744individuals, 32,810 display negative skewness in their gross daily results. The median skewness across the 39,744individuals is \u22121.40, and the average skewness is \u22121.72.11 [Figure 2 about here] The strong negative skewness of daily results leads to individuals profiting on most of the days but, at the same time, losing money by day-trading. 4.2 The disposition effect generates skewness Individuals with the disposition effect tend to call it a day if the initial trades are profitable but are likely to keep on day-trading if they are losing. As a result, they may recover their losses but may also lose more. Hence, the disposition effect will 11The 1st percentile is \u22129.25, the 5th percentile is \u22125.79, the 95th percentile is 1.36, and the 99th percentile is 3.41. Hence, the skewness distribution is also negatively skewed (-1.00). 18mechanically inflate the proportion of days with a positive result \u2014 but also raise the size of the losses. In this section, we first show a strong disposition effect among day traders, con- sistent with previous literature (see Linnainmaa, 2003, Linnainmaa, 2005, Jordan and Diltz, 2003, and Heimer, 2016). We then show that, as expected, individuals with a stronger disposition effect tend to present higher Propand a more negative skewness in their daily results. To directly measure the disposition effect among day traders, we obtained a sub- sample with the entire intraday trading activity of 3,980 individuals from our original dataset from CVM. This subsample was randomly selected from the 39,744 individuals in our full dataset, subject to including 10% of individuals from each of the 12 groups in Table 1. For each individual, we have the instrument (futures contract or stock) traded, the quantities purchased and sold, the corresponding prices, and the timestamp of each deal. Overall, we have 13,130,771 different deals. On average, there were 22 deals at the id-instrument-day level, resulting in 594,165 different id-instrument-day day trades. At the id-day level, we have 430,805 different trading days, with an average of 108 days with a day trade per individual. First, we verify whether day traders display the disposition effect using the intra- day data set.",

We compute the duration of a day trade as the time elapsed from the day\u2019s first deal to its last deal. The average duration of the 430,805 different day trades is 238 minutes, the 25th percentile is 80 minutes, the median is 235 minutes, and the 75th percentile is 385 minutes. We then condition the total duration of a day trade on a dummy variable indicating whether the day trade 19from individual ion day dwas profitable. We estimate the following hazard function: hi,d(t) =h0(t) exp( \u03b2Gain i,d+X\u2032 i\u03b3) (3) where Xidenote the control variables that we include in the model: the total number of day trades by individual iand the total profit obtained by individual i. The results from the Cox proportional hazard model confirm that day traders dis- play a disposition effect. The estimate for \u03b2in Equation (3) is 0.176, significantly larger than zero with a t-statistic of 57. This coefficient implies that at any given point, the probability of a day trader closing the position for the day is 19.2% higher if she is at a gain than if she is at a loss ( 1.192 = exp(0 .176)). Figure 3 shows the resulting survival function up until minute 240 (the median duration of a day trade is 235 minutes), which indicates the probability of a day trader continuing day-trading conditional on having a gain or a loss. [Figure 3 about here] Next, we examine the extent to which day traders with a higher \u201c Prop\u201d also tend to display a stronger disposition effect and a more negative skewness in their daily results using this intraday dataset. To do so, we estimate the Cox proportional hazard model for each individual in our subsample. Table 8 presents the same summary statistics as before with the addition of columns 6 and 7. Column 6 shows the average skewness acrossdaytradersof Result, computedasbeforeusingallindividuals\u2019dailygrossprofits in US dollars. Column 7 shows the average across all point estimates of the hazard rate to closing a position conditional on a profitable day \u2013 a positive coefficient indicates a disposition effect. [Table 8 about here] 20First, we can see that the overall patterns observed in the full sample are also observed in this subsample with 10% of the number of individuals, which is reassuring. As before, going from group 1 to group 12, the fraction of individuals with positive profits declines (column 4), but the average fraction of individuals that profit on more than50%oftheirtradingdaysincreases(column5), andtheaverageskewnessdecreases almost monotonically ( column 6). Finally, the average estimates of the hazard rate increase as we move from lower to higher groups, implying the latter have a higher dispositioneffect. Inthefirstfourgroups, theaverageestimatesare0.18,0.12, 0.19, and 0.19, while in groups 9, 10, 11, and 12, they are 0.31, 0.24, 0.25, and 0.25, respectively. To relate a day trader\u2019s proportion of profitable days, Prop, and the skewness of their daily results, Skewness , with their propensity to display the disposition effect, we run cross-sectional regressions across individuals. We control for the total gross profit obtained by the day trader and the number of days the individual has day-traded. Panel A of Table 9 shows the results for Propand Panel B for Skewness . [Table 9 about here] Table 9 shows that the disposition effect is positively related to Propand negatively related to Skewness across individuals. For instance, in Column 2 of Panel A, a change of 0.10 in the estimated D.E. coefficient is associated with an increase of 0.8% in the proportion of days with positive profit ( 0.008 = 0 .084\u00d70.10). This result holds for individuals who have day-traded for more than 250 days (Group 12) and those within Group 1. In turn, Column 2 of Panel B shows that a change of 0.10 in the estimated D.E. coefficient is associated with a 0.09 lower skewness of daily results (\u22120.09 = 0 .923\u00d70.10). This effect also holds within group 1 and within group 12.",

        "content": "214.3 A model to infer individuals\u2019 actual skill We have shown that Propis a biased measure of performance. We now develop and estimate a model to infer the counterfactual proportion of profitable days among day traders if they displayed no disposition effect. 4.3.1 The model A day is divided into two periods. At the beginning of period 1, an individual makes a bet of size normalized to 1. At the end of period 1, they earn y1= 1\u00d7x1, where x1 is a draw from a N(\u00b5, \u03c3)distribution.12Parameters \u00b5and\u03c3determine the chances of obtaining a positive result and hence pin down their actual skill. Ify1>0, the individual stops trading for that day, but may continue if y1<0. At the start of period 2, those who lost in the first period make a bet of size \u2212\u03b1\u00d7y1. It is proportional to the loss from period 1, where \u03b1\u22650and will be estimated from data. The parameter \u03b1is a measure of the disposition effect since it captures the increase in their position after a negative result in the first period. If \u03b1= 0, there is no disposition effect. At the end of period 2, they earn y2=\u2212\u03b1\u00d7y1\u00d7x2, where x2is another independent draw from the same N(\u00b5, \u03c3)distribution. The total result from that day is thus given by y=y1+y2=x1(1\u2212\u03b1\u00d7x21(x1\u22640)), where 1(\u00b7)denotes the indicator function. We can decompose the expression above as follows. Let f(z;\u00b5, \u03c3)andF(z;\u00b5, \u03c3) denote the pdf and cdf, respectively, of the normal distribution with mean \u00b5and standard deviation \u03c3atz\u2208R. Let x(+)denote the truncated normal distribution with 12The results are qualitatively the same if we assume a t-distribution instead. 22parameters \u00b5and\u03c3on the interval (0,\u221e)with pdf f(+)(z;\u00b5, \u03c3) =f(z;\u00b5, \u03c3) 1\u2212F(0;\u00b5, \u03c3)1(z >0). Likewise, let x(\u2212)denote the truncated normal distribution with parameters \u00b5and\u03c3 on the interval (\u2212\u221e,0]with pdf f(\u2212)(z;\u00b5, \u03c3) =f(z;\u00b5, \u03c3) F(0;\u00b5, \u03c3)1(z\u22640). Finally, let Bdenote a random variable from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter p=P(x1>0) = 1 \u2212F(0;\u00b5, \u03c3). Then the distribution of the total result from day-trading on a given day can be alter- natively expressed as y=B\u00d7x(+)+ (1\u2212B)\u00d7[x(\u2212)(1\u2212\u03b1x2)]. (4) 4.3.2 Estimation procedure Next, we estimate parameters \u03b1,\u00b5, and \u03c3using day traders observed daily results and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) with the following moments: (i) P(y >0), (ii)E(y), (iii) Var( y) and (iv) Skew( y). The closed-form expressions for the 23four moments of interest are:13 P(y >0) = 1 \u2212\u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3) + \u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)\u0012 1\u2212\u03a6\u00121\u2212\u03b1\u00b5 \u03b1\u03c3\u0013\u0013 (5) E(y) =\u00b5(1\u2212\u03b1\u00b5) + (1\u2212\u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3))\u03b1\u00b52+\u03b1\u03c3\u00b5\u03d5 (\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3) (6) E(y2) =\u00b52+\u03c32+\u0000 \u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)(\u00b52+\u03c32)\u2212\u00b5\u03c3\u03d5(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)\u0003 \u0002 \u03b12(\u00b52+\u03c32)\u22122\u03b1\u00b5\u0003 (7) E(y3) =\u00b53+ 3\u00b5\u03c32+\u0002 \u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)(\u00b53+ 3\u00b5\u03c32)\u2212\u03c3(\u00b52+ 2\u03c32)\u03d5(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)\u0003 \u00d7\u0002 3\u03b12(\u00b52+\u03c32)\u22123\u03b1\u00b5\u2212\u03b13(\u00b53+ 3\u00b5\u03c32)\u0003 (8) where \u03a6and\u03d5denotethecdfandpdf, respectively, ofthestandardnormaldistribution. We can compute V ar(y) =E(y2)\u2212E(y)2, using Equations (6) and (7). Finally, we get Skew (y) =E(y3)\u22123E(y)V ar(y)\u2212E(y)3 V ar(y)3 2, by combining V ar(y)with Equations (7) and (8). With \u00b5and\u03c3, we can compute the probability of a positive result in period 1, 1\u2212F(0;\u00b5, \u03c3), which is different than the probability of obtaining a positive result in the day (period 1 plus period 2) because it is not contaminated by the disposition effect. We refer to the probability of obtaining a positive result in period 1 as the \u2018actual skill\u2019. Since we consider individuals who trade different volumes, our measure of results is the daily gross profit of each day trader on each day divided by the average of their absolutegrossprofitoverthepast30tradingdays(i.e., StdResult , asdefinedinSection 4.1). 13see Appendix B for the derivation. 244.3.3 Estimation results Table 10 shows the estimates considering all 39,744 day traders and their results for days 31st, 32nd, and so on. [Table 10 about here] The estimate of \u03b1is 0.489, indicating that day traders display a strong disposition effect: on average, a trader with a negative result bets an extra amount close to half of their losses. Table10showsthattheestimatedprobabilityofwinninginperiod1(\u2018model\u2019sskill\u2019, given by 1\u2212F(0; \u02c6\u00b5,\u02c6\u03c3)) equals 0.467. This can interpreted as the odds of winning on a day in the absence of the disposition effect. In contrast, the biased skill, Prop, is0.523. The distance between the biased and the actual skill, i.e., the bias from the disposition effect, is rather large, equal to 5.6percentage points. The table also shows an alternative estimate of day traders\u2019 skill based on our intraday data from a subset of day trades discussed in section 4.2 (Intraday data\u2019s skill).",

        "content": "For each day trader\u2019s transaction, we calculate the result after 20 minutes.14 This estimated measure of skill equals 0.478. While this refers to each single decision, the estimate from the model refers to the set of trades that would occur without the disposition effect. Hence, the estimates are not directly comparable, but both should be either higher or lower than 50%, and the measure based on a single trade should be closer to 50%. This is exactly what we find. It is also illustrative to examine how the actual and biased skill evolve for investors who persisted in day-trading. To do that, we estimate the model parameters for the 14Specifically, we compute the cumulative return from the purchasing or selling price up until 20 minutes in the future, multiplying by minus one the cumulative return if a sale occurred. We exclude deals closed within the last 20 minutes of the trading day. Then, we determine the fraction of all profitable transactions at this time horizon. We use a 20-minute horizon because it represents the unconditional average duration of a day trader\u2019s deal. 25individuals in Group 12, as defined in Section 3, from day 31 to day 60, 61 to 90, and so on up to day 241 to the last one. Table 11 presents the results. [Table 11 about here] The actual skill estimate 1\u2212F(0; \u02c6\u00b5,\u02c6\u03c3)remains flat around 47%, reflecting a roughly constant ratio \u00b5/\u03c3. Reassuringly, the true skill estimated with the sub-sample of investors for whom we observed their intraday activity is also constant, around 48%. Both measures are not supposed to be the same, but should display similar patterns. The finding that day traders do not learn with experience is consistent with previous research \u2013 see Chague, De-Losso, and Giovannetti (2019) and Barber et al. (2020). Second, we find a very large increase in \u03b1. The coefficient doubles over time, going from 0.386 to 0.796. Accordingly, the biased measure of skill also increases with experience. It begins at 0.515 and reaches a whopping 0.567 in the last bin. Since day traders look at the biased skill to decide when to stop, a growing \u03b1creates a perverse dynamics for the learning process about their own skill. 5 Concluding remarks This paper investigates all retail day trading activity in Brazil from 2012 to 2018. It shows that (i) individuals use a simple counting heuristic (the frequency of profitable trading days)to decide whether tocontinue trading and(ii) display a strongdisposition effect. Asaresult, theirlearningabouttheirowntradingskillsisbiased. Thesefindings shed light on the drivers under individual traders\u2019 overconfidence. Our study focuses on day trading, but there is reason to believe this behavior extends to other trading activities. This is because accurately measuring day trading results requires only adding up daily profits, while evaluating the performance of a 26portfolio is a much harder task, as it requires considering risk and comparing returns to benchmarks. Our conclusions matter for policy. Day trading and swing trading are booming in many countries. Informing individuals about their actual odds of success might deter many of them from spending time and money on an endeavor bound to fail.15 15The Brazilian exchange, B3, should take note. At present, they do precisely the opposite by showing on their website the proportion of day traders that profit each day (see, for instance, a recent report available here). It is a simple statistic to show, they would argue. It is indeed, and that is why it has the power to confuse hapless individuals in search of a thrilling way to make a living. 27References Augenblick, Ned, Eben Lazarus, and Michael Thaler, 2024, Overinference from Weak Signals and Underinference from Strong Signals, Working paper.

For each moment of interest, we first derive the moment equation for a general distributional specification for x1andx2. Under the normal specification, the moment equations have closed-form expressions, based on the moments of the truncated normal distribution. These are also computed below. A recursive derivation of the moments of the truncated normal distribution can be found in Orjebin (2014) and Horrace (2014). The formulas for these moments are used throughout the rest of this Section. In cases when closed-form solutions are not available, the moments are usually straightforwardtocomputenumerically. ThroughouttherestofthisSection, wedenote by\u03d5(\u00b7)and\u03a6(\u00b7)and pdf and cdf, respectively, of the standard normal distribution. B.1 Derivation of P(y >0) First, notice that: P(y >0) = P(B= 1) + (1 \u2212P(B= 1))\u00b7P(x(\u2212)\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b1x2)>0) = (1\u2212F(0;\u00b5, \u03c3)) +F(0;\u00b5, \u03c3)\u00b7P(x(\u2212)\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b1x2)>0) (9) Simplifying the last term above, we have that: P(x(\u2212)\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b1x2)>0) =P(1\u2212\u03b1x2<0) =P\u0012 x2>1 \u03b1\u0013 = 1\u2212F(1/\u03b1;\u00b5, \u03c3) Thus, Equation (9) only requires computations of the cdfs of the generalized and truncated normal distributions. Indeed, notice that a crucial step for this result is 47that the probability of getting a positive profit in the second trading session does not depend on the size of the losses during the first session. Since x(\u2212)is negative with probability 1, we only need (1\u2212\u03b1x2)to be positive to ensure that yis positive in this case. Assuming the session profits follow a normal distribution, p= 1\u2212\u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)and Equation (9) simplifies to: P(y >0) = 1 \u2212\u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3) + \u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)\u0012 1\u2212\u03a6\u00121\u2212\u03b1\u00b5 \u03b1\u03c3\u0013\u0013 (10) which is a simple function of the underlying parameters.",

B.3 Derivation of Var( y) LetE(y) :=\u00b5y. By expanding y2in Equation (4) and applying expectations, we have: y2=Bx2 (+)+ (1\u2212B)(1\u2212\u03b1x2)2x2 (\u2212)+ 2B(1\u2212B)x(+)x(\u2212)(1\u2212\u03b1x2) =\u21d2E(y2) =pE\u0000 x2 (+)\u0001 + (1\u2212p)E\u0000 x2 (\u2212)\u0001 E\u0000 [1\u2212\u03b1x2]2\u0001 . (15) Notice that the cancellation of the third above term comes from B(1\u2212B)\u22610. This fact will be used again when computing the skewness. Besides: E\u0000 [1\u2212\u03b1x2]2\u0001 =\u03b12E(x2 2)\u22122\u03b1E(x2) + 1 (16) After plugging Equation (16) into Equation (15), we have E(y2), which in turn allows us to compute V ar(y) :=\u03c32 y=E(y2)\u2212E2(y), where E(y)comes from Equation (11). 49Under the normality specification, we have the following additional simplifications: E\u0000 x2 (+)\u0001 =\u00b52+\u03c32+\u03c3\u00b5\u03d5(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3) 1\u2212\u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)(17) E\u0000 x2 (\u2212)\u0001 =\u00b52+\u03c32\u2212\u03c3\u00b5\u03d5(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3) \u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)(18) E\u0002 (1\u2212\u03b1x2)2\u0003 = 1\u22122\u03b1\u00b5+\u03b12(\u00b52+\u03c32) (19) Substituting these expressions into Equation (15) and canceling out terms, we can compute E(y2)in terms of the parameters as: E(y2) =\u00b52+\u03c32+\u0000 \u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)(\u00b52+\u03c32)\u2212\u00b5\u03c3\u03d5(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)\u0003 \u0002 \u03b12(\u00b52+\u03c32)\u22122\u03b1\u00b5\u0003 (20) Finally, we are then able to compute V ar(y) =E(y2)\u2212E(y)2, where E(y)comes from Equation (14). B.4 Derivation of Skew( y) We now proceed to compute E(y3)analogously to what was done before: y3=Bx3 (+)+ (1\u2212B)x3 (\u2212)(1\u2212\u03b1x2)3=\u21d2 E(y3) =pE\u0000 x3 (+)\u0001 + (1\u2212p)E\u0000 x3 (\u2212)\u0001 E\u0000 [1\u2212\u03b1x2]3\u0001 , (21) where the cross terms involving B\u00d7(1\u2212B)cancel out as in Equation (15). By expanding the last term, we have: E\u0000 [1\u2212\u03b1x2]3\u0001 =\u2212\u03b13E(x3 2) + 3\u03b12E(x2 2)\u22123\u03b1E(x2) + 1. (22) 50By plugging Equation (22) into Equation (21) we can compute E(y3), which in turn allows us to compute Skew( y) as: Skew (y) =E \u0014y\u2212\u00b5y \u03c3y\u00153! =E(y3)\u22123\u00b5y\u03c32 y\u2212\u00b53 y \u03c33 y, (23) Under the normal specification, we again have the following additional simplifica- tions: E\u0000 x3 (+)\u0001 =\u00b53+ 3\u00b5\u03c32+\u03c3\u0014(\u00b52+ 2\u03c32)\u03d5(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3) 1\u2212\u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)\u0015 (24) E\u0000 x3 (\u2212)\u0001 =\u00b53+ 3\u00b5\u03c32\u2212\u03c3\u0014(\u00b52+ 2\u03c32)\u03d5(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3) \u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)\u0015 (25) E\u0002 (1\u2212\u03b1x)3\u0003 = 1\u22123\u03b1\u00b5+ 3\u03b12(\u00b52+\u03c32)\u2212\u03b13(\u00b53+ 3\u00b5\u03c32) (26) Substituting these terms into Equation (21) and doing some algebraic manipulations leads us to: E(y3) =\u00b53+ 3\u00b5\u03c32+\u0002 \u03a6(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)(\u00b53+ 3\u00b5\u03c32)\u2212\u03c3(\u00b52+ 2\u03c32)\u03d5(\u2212\u00b5/\u03c3)\u0003 \u00d7\u0002 3\u03b12(\u00b52+\u03c32)\u22123\u03b1\u00b5\u2212\u03b13(\u00b53+ 3\u00b5\u03c32)\u0003 (27) We can then compute Skew (y)as : Skew (y) =E(y3)\u22123E(y)V ar(y)\u2212E(y)3 V ar(y)3 2, (28) where E(y)andV ar(y)are derived in the previous subsections. 51",

Participants with lower financial literacy prefer platforms with hedonic gamification elements, such as confetti and achievement badges. On average, hedonic gamification increases trading volume by 5.17%. However, the difference in trading activity between gamified and non-gamified platforms is driven primarily by self-selection (70%) rather than gamification (30%). Participants who prefer hedonic gamification exhibit noisy trading strategies, while those favoring non-gamified platforms display stronger contrarian behavior. Further, price trend notifications enhance learning for investors with accurate beliefs, but reinforce trading mistakes for those with incorrect beliefs.

What does it mean when balloons and confetti are dropping and you have behavioral prompts to get investors to do more transactions?\u201d \u2013 Gary Gensler, Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (March 2, 2021) Does the design of retail-facing trading applications impact the behavior of individual investors? The share of retail volume in US equity markets more than doubled in the past decade, from 10.1% in 2010 to more than 23% in January 2023. As a group, retail traders are now the second largest market segment after high-frequency traders, ahead of hedge funds or bank-affiliated traders. The six largest online brokerages (Fidelity, Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Webull, Robinhood, and Interactive Brokers) have more than 100 million combined users. Between January and December 2021, Robinhood reported a 47% increase in active monthly users (from 11.7M to 17.3M) and a 55% increase in assets under custody (from $63bn to $98bn).1 What is driving the recent surge in retail trading? Part of the effect can be traced back to the COVID-19 pandemic. A shift in work patterns and entertainment opportunities, doubled by heightened volatility and \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d whetted the risk appetite of work-from-home traders. However, we argue that there are structural forces at play \u2013 in particular the digitalization and decentralization of asset management: a transition from human advisers in brick-and-mortar institutions to self-managed trading on computer and mobile platforms. Online brokers are grappling with a zero lower bound on fees, prompting them to seek novel ways to differentiate themselves from competitors. One approach is to offer investors trading apps with sleek interfaces designed to increase trading volume and user engagement with the platform. As a result, these applications are progressively adopting gamification elements, such as vibrant colors, celebratory animations (like confetti), and other prompts designed to encourage users to engage in more frequent trading. 1See Wall Street Journal, Individual-Investor Boom Reshapes U.S. Stock Market , August 31, 2020; Reuters, Factbox: The U.S. retail trading frenzy in numbers , January 29, 2021; Robinhood Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Results , January 27, 2022; and Bloomberg, Day Trading Army\u2019s Grip on Stock Market Is Tighter Than in Meme Stock Era , February 2, 2023. 1 Does the gamification of trading apps influence individual investor behavior?",

        "content": "The question is of first-order importance for regulators: The retail-driven trading frenzy of GameStop equities in January 2021 prompted Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to raise concerns about the potential impact of \u201cbehavioral technology\u201d and gamification on trading app users.2Furthermore, in December 2020 Robinhood faced an administrative complaint by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for \u201caggressive marketing\u201d deemed not in the best interest of investors. More recently, in April 2022 Verena Ross, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), expressed concern that gamification techniques in trading apps could lead retail investors to engage in trading behavior without understanding the risks involved.3 Inthispaper, weproposearandomizedcontrolledexperimenttoassessthebehavioralexternalities of trading gamification. In particular, we study the impact of gamification strategies on the intensity of retail traders\u2019 trading activity, trading mistakes, the magnitude of the disposition effect, and the ease of information processing. The experimental design allows us to provide a nuanced analysis of gamification by distinguishing the impact of gamification elements that convey price-relevant information and those that do not. The experimental approach solves the problem of endogenous platform choice by randomly assigning participants to gamified and non-gamified platforms, which allows for a causal estimation of the impact of trading gamification on investor behavior. We build an experimental platform in oTree ( Chen et al. ,2016) starting from the classical investment games in Frydman et al. (2014) andWeber and Camerer (1998). The experiment comprises four rounds of trading, each lasting five minutes, in addition to a brief training round. Participants can buy and sell a risky asset in real time but cannot short sell or hold more than one unit at a time. However, they can borrow cash at a zero interest rate. The asset price process has predictable momentum and follows a Markov chain process with two highly persistent states. Incorporating momentum in our experimental asset price process emphasizes the disposition effect in the data\u2013given that the optimal strategy of a Bayesian investor would display the very opposite behavior\u2013and allows us to highlight its interaction with gamification and information, with further 2See Bloomberg, Gensler Targets Broker \u2018Gamification\u2019 After Trading Tumult , March 2, 2021. 3SeeESMA makes recommendations to improve investor protection , April 29, 2022. 2 insights provided when momentum is removed.4 Participants trade on either a gamified or non-gamified platform in each trading round. To design the gamified platform, we draw inspiration from popular trading apps such as Robinhood, EToro, and Binance. Our gamified platform features two types of gamification elements: hedonic andinformational . Hedonic gamification elements, which relate to the sensory and emotional aspects of user experience, are designed to encourage prolonged rather than productive use of the product (Hirschman and Holbrook ,1982;van der Heijden ,2004). For trading platforms, these elements include reward animations and badges upon completing a certain number of trades. On the contrary, informational gamification elements include notifications about trending stocks and significant price swings. We conjecture, based on a simple theoretical framework following Frydman and Rangel (2014), that hedonic and informational strategies have a distinct impact on investor behavior. On one hand, achievement badges and animations might encourage excessive trading and suboptimal buy and sell decisions. On the other, price movement notifications may reduce information processing costs and steer investors toward better trading decisions by reducing the disposition effect\u2014particularly by encouraging them to realize losses. We recruit 958 experimental subjects from Prolific, a subject pool for online experiments, to participate in the trading game on April 11 and April 12, 2023.5We build a population-representative sample of the United States and United Kingdom (using census data from these countries), stratified by age, gender, and ethnic group. We administer a 12-question financial literacy quiz based on Fernandes et al. (2014) to participants, and also elicit a self-assessment of their financial knowledge. After the experiment, we inquire about participants\u2019 preferences between gamified and non-gamified designs. Our results reveal that, after controlling for realized profits, individuals with lower financial literacy tend to favor trading platform with hedonic gamification elements such as confetti and achievement badges. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation decrease in the financial quiz score leads 4Our price process is almost identical to the one in Frydman et al.",

At the same time, we find no relationship between financial literacy and participants\u2019 inclination towards informational gamification elements such as price trend notifications. Our first experimental session focuses on hedonic gamification elements such as confetti and badges. On average, hedonic gamification leads to a marginally significant 5.17% increase in trading activity. However, the impact of gamification is more pronounced (a 12.5% increase) for participants who prefer the hedonic design. Our findings suggest that there is a significant selection effect, as participants who prefer hedonic gamification tend to trade 21.4% more than their counterparts even on non-gamified platforms. We estimate that 70% of the gap in trading activity between gamified and non-gamified platforms can be attributed to self-selection (i.e., participant preferences), while the remaining 30% is traced to the direct impact of gamification. We find no evidence that hedonic gamification leads to an increase in trading mistakes. Nonethe- less, we do observe that participants who have a preference for gamified or non-gamified platforms tend to deviate from a Bayesian benchmark in distinct ways. Specifically, those who prefer non- gamified platforms tend to sell the asset after a series of price increases and buy it back after a string of price drops. This behavior aligns with an irrational belief that the stock price follows a mean-reverting process. As a result, participants who favor non-gamified platform trade too little relative to the Bayesian benchmark and exhibit a large disposition effect. Participants who prefer gamified platforms tend to trade more and at seemingly random times. On aggregate, we find that participants with low financial literacy who prefer hedonic gamification tend to have more noisytrading strategies, while those who self-select into non-gamified platforms exhibit stronger contrarian behavior, in that their strategy is biasedrelative to a Bayesian trader. In a separate experimental session, we analyze the impact of information-based gamification. Optimally, participants in our experiment should buy the stock when its price rises and sell it when the price drops, given the momentum embedded in the price process. We document that the impact of price trend notifications depends on the accuracy of traders\u2019 beliefs about the price process. For traders with correct beliefs, notifications appear to improve learning by reducing information constraints. These traders are more likely to buy the stock after receiving a price increase alert, but 4 do not realize their losses after receiving a drop alert. In a setting without momentum, where a martingale price process renders notifications uninformative, participants holding correct beliefs cease responding to alerts. This result underscores that informative price notifications can indeed enhance learning. Conversely, notifications reinforce contrarian behavior for traders with inaccurate beliefs, leading to even greater deviations from the Bayesian benchmark. These traders are 31.81% more likely to sell the asset after a positive alert and 37.5% more likely to buy the asset after a negative alert. We also find that price trend notifications amplify the disposition effect, due to traders with incorrect beliefs experiencing a rise in realized gains. 2 Related literature Digital trading platforms. Our paper fits into a growing literature on digital trading platforms. Closest to our paper, Arnold et al. (2021) find that push notifications alerting investors about large price swings increase risk taking, as measured by leverage. Moss(2022) documents that push Robinhood notifications increase the intensity of retail trading by 25% for 15 minutes after the alert.Kalda et al. (2021) study transaction-level data from two German banks, and find that investors execute riskier trades on smartphones than on other, more traditional platforms. Our study stands out by conducting a controlled experiment that introduces various gamification elements while measuring trading mistakes, beliefs, and behavioral biases such as the disposition effect. Our randomized approach eliminates selection bias and allows us to measure the impact of financial literacy and trading experience on gamification and investor behavior. Overall, our findings provide insights into how gamification affects investor decision-making and trading behavior on digital platforms. Retail trading.",

        "content": "Our paper further contributes to a resurgent literature on retail trading. Previous studies have shown that individual traders often lack information and are susceptible to behavioral biases. This is reinforced by research conducted by Barber and Odean (2000,2007), which found that retail traders tend to exhibit overconfidence, engage in excessive turnover, and show a preference for small high-beta stocks that capture their attention. 5 More recent evidence ( Kaniel et al. ,2008;Kelley and Tetlock ,2013) suggests retail order flow may be a predictor of future stock returns: aggressive trades can predict future news, whereas passive orders are contrarian and provide liquidity. Barber et al. (2022) show that the design of the Robinhood trading app (in particular, the Top Movers tab) steers investors\u2019 attention to stocks with extreme returns, leading to portfolio underperformance. At the same time, Welch(2022) documents that, in aggregate, retail investors using the Robinhood app performed well between 2018 and 2020. Our paper contributes to this literature by examining how the design of trading platforms impacts the portfolio choices of retail traders. Gamification and behavior. Our paper relates to research in computer science, marketing, and psychology studying gamification and its impact on consumer actions. Deterding et al. (2011) define gamification as \u201cthe use of game design elements in non-game contexts.\u201d Hirschman and Holbrook (1982) andHuotari and Hamari (2012) relate gamification to hedonic consumption of multisensory and emotive aspects of the product user experience, generating value beyond its utilitarian role ( van der Heijden ,2004).Csikszentmihalyi et al. (2014) emphasize that gamification elements are intrinsically rewarding if they establish clear goals and provide immediate feedback to users. However, the scholarly literature on gamification in finance is relatively scant. Baptista and Oliveira(2017) andRodrigues et al. (2016) find that customers are more likely to use a banking app if it emphasizes the hedonic element. Further, gamification elements such as achievement badges can yield greater engagement with platforms ( Kwon et al. ,2015).6 Disposition effect experiments. The disposition effect, first identified by Odean(1998), is defined as an empirical pattern wherein traders are more likely to realize profits than losses. We build our experimental design on a series of classical investment games ( Weber and Camerer ,1998; Frydman et al. ,2014) that study the disposition effect starting from the realization utility model of Barberis and Xiong (2012) andIngersoll and Jin (2013). We contribute to this strand of experimental 6A related strand of literature in behavioral finance studies the impact of emotional state on trading decisions. Existing work shows that positive feelings exacerbate risk-taking (see, e.g., Kuhnen and Knutson ,2011;Andrade et al. , 2015) and overconfidence ( Breaban and Noussair ,2017) while negative emotions are associated with heightened risk aversion ( Kamstra et al. ,2003) but potentially lower loss aversion ( Campos-Vazquez and Cuilty ,2014). 6 finance literature by studying the impact of platform gamification strategies on the magnitude of the disposition effect. FinTech and financial literacy. Finally, our paper relates to a growing literature on financial literacy and technology innovations. While FinTech aims to make financial services more accessible for individuals with low financial literacy, it may also exacerbate existing financial barriers and inequalities, as evidenced by Haran Rosen and Sade (2022).Karlan et al. (2016) highlight that digital finance has the potential to improve products and market conditions, but success requires a nuanced understanding of market failures affecting low-income and low\u2013financial literacy households. To promote financial inclusion, it is important to integrate FinTech with supportive financial and digital literacy programs. Relying solely on simplified behavioral insights may be more effective than traditional financial education methods ( Drexler et al. ,2014). Confidence in one\u2019s financial knowledge, in addition to measured financial literacy, is crucial for making sound investment decisions, as emphasized by Allgood and Walstad (2016),Bannier and Schwarz (2018), andCup\u00e1k et al.(2020). In this study, we investigate how trading gamification impacts investor behavior, moderated by both objective and perceived financial literacy. 3 Experimental design We start by describing the experimental market in Section 3.1, followed by the design of the trading platform and gamification features in Section 3.2.",

(2014) andWeber and Camerer (1998), who build laboratory markets to study the disposition effect in stock trading (i.e., the investors\u2019 tendency to sell winners too early and hold on to loser stocks for too long). In the same spirit, we 7In February 2023, following the approval of our registered report at Management Science, we filed a pre-analysis plan which is available online at https://osf.io/ud3ts/?view_only=91f98723bea34744ad666bde289ebc8e . The experiment was performed exactly as proposed. We largely follow the empirical analysis described in the pre-analysis plan, enhancing it to include results across different participant subsamples. 7 focus on individual decision-making in a trading game while abstracting from market clearing and price formation concerns. Market and endowments. Participants are given the opportunity to trade one virtual stock on a laboratory market over four rounds. Each round consists of 60 trials, indexed by t: each trial corresponds to a stock price update and lasts for five seconds. Asset prices and participants\u2019 payoffs are denominated in \u201cexperimental dollars\u201d (E$), an artificial laboratory currency, and converted into Canadian dollars at the end of the experiment. The exchange rate between experimental and Canadian dollars is E$1 = CA$0.05. At the start of each round, each participant is endowed with E$50 and one unit of the stock. The stock has an initial price of E$100, and therefore the total endowment of each participant is equivalent to E$150. The rationale behind having a cash buffer is to absorb stock market losses throughout the round and make it less likely that the limited liability constraint binds. At any point during the round, each participant can hold at most one unit of the stock. Further, short selling is not allowed. The constraints simplify the participants\u2019 strategy space, allowing for a sharper identification of the mechanisms at play. Due to the limited time participants have to make trading decisions, an increase in the number of \u201crational\u201d trades could reduce the potential for gamification-induced trades and lower the statistical power of our tests. To avoid this, a participant only has to choose whether to buy the stock if they are not already holding it, or whether to sell the stock if they do hold it. While trading, participants are effectively allowed to borrow and carry negative cash balances. However, to compute the end-of-round payoff, any negative balance at the end of the round is subtracted from the value of the stock portfolio. Following Frydman et al. (2014), trading is disallowed for the first four trials of each round. This allows participants to learn by observing the asset price movements before engaging in trading decisions. From t= 5onward, participants can freely buy and sell the stock at any time, conditional on staying within the position limits. Asset price. The stock price is updated for every trial following a two-state Markov chain process. In the \u201cgood\u201d state ( g), the stock price increases with probability 0.55 and decreases with probability 8 0.45. In the \u201cbad\u201d state ( b), the probabilities are reversed: the price has a 45% chance of going up and a 55% chance of falling. The size of price changes is drawn with equal probabilities from the set fE$5;E$10;E$15g. The magnitude and direction of price changes are drawn independently. Conditional on being in state i2 fg; bgat trial t, the stock has an 85% chance of remaining in state iat trial t+ 1and a 15% chance of switching to state \u0000i. Thus, the stock price exhibits momentum and is therefore predictable; price increases (drops) are likely to be followed by further increases (drops). Participants receive information on the process used to generate prices and the transition probabilities, but we do not disclose the state in any given trial. Instead, each participant has to use the history of prices to infer the current state and make predictions about future returns. To facilitate comparison across experimental subjects, we use the same price histories for all participants.",

        "content": "As a robustness check, we also run an experimental session in which the asset price is a martingale (i.e., there is no momentum). If stock returns exhibit momentum, acting upon gamification elements that highlight information is a good idea, but that might not be the case if prices are a martingale or if they mean-revert. The robustness session without built-in momentum allows us to determine whether certain gamification features, such as price notifications, ameliorate investors\u2019 attention constraints or if they simply nudge them into trading. Participant beliefs. To assess participants\u2019 perception of asset pricing trends, we follow Weber and Camerer (1998) and directly elicit beliefs about the current state of the stock. Concretely, for each round we pause trading for 20 seconds before trial t= 40and display the following questions: How likely is the stock to go up next? andHow confident are you in this assessment? followed by a sliding scale that allows participants to select the perceived probability of an uptick in the following trial and a five-point Likert scale to measure confidence. Moreover, we also obtain participant beliefs prior to trial t= 1. At the beginning of each round, absent any price history, the stock is equally likely to be in a good or a bad state. We ask participants \u201cHow likely is the stock to go up in the first period?\u201d and provide a sliding scale on which they can select the probability of the stock price going up (denoted by u), as well as the level 9 of confidence in the evaluation. We then use their answer to build a measure of prior beliefs about the stock price as 1\u00002\u0002 ju\u00000:5j, which is higher if the participant\u2019s belief is closer to the correct answer u= 0:5. Treatments. Our experimental design is a mixture of \u201cwithin\u201d and \u201cbetween\u201d treatments. Im- portantly, all participants are exposed to both non-gamified and gamified markets and we measure their performance in both these trading environments. However, each participant is only exposed to one combination of gamification elements; that is, a single version of a gamified market. In the experiment, following the taxonomy of Gallo(2022) we distinguish between purely hedonic gamification elements\u2014achievement badges, confetti, or congratulatory messages\u2014that aim to increase engagement with the platform on one hand, and on the other hand gamification elements that highlight information, such as price swing notifications. We provide an in-depth discussion on gamification elements and connect our experimental design elements with the gamification strategies of real-life trading platforms considered in Section 3.2and Online Appendix E. The SEC also enumerates these particular gamification strategies in its August 2021 request for comments.8 The four between-subject sessions of the experiment, where each session features a different combination of gamification strategies, are: 1.Session I : Non-gamified + Gamified with only hedonic elements of gamification, 2.Session II : Non-gamified + Gamified with informational elements (i.e., price notifications), 3.Session III : Non-gamified + Gamified with both hedonic and informational elements, 4.Session IV (robustness) : Non-gamified + Gamified with only informational elements as in Session II, but the price process is a martingale. Each participant trades in both non-gamified and gamified platforms, so that (i) we establish a baseline trading behavior at the participant level and (ii) we are able to elicit preferences between gamified and non-gamified designs. At the same time, each participant is exposed to a single type of gamification treatment. That is, the gamification strategies vary between participants. This 8Seehttps://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2021/34-92766.pdf , pages 7 and 8. 10 experimental setup allows us to disentangle the effects of hedonic and informational gamification strategies. The robustness session allows decomposing the price notification effect into a \u201cnudge to trade\u201d component (the effect in Session IV) and a \u201crational attention improvement\u201d component (the positive difference, if any, between the effects in Session II and Session IV). In addition to the between-treatments variability, there is variability within each experimental session. Each of the four sessions has four trading rounds: two gamified and two non-gamified (in random order). Additionally, the purchase price may be prominently displayed on the platform (high salience) or not (low salience).",

In contrast, during low-salience rounds the purchase price is not displayed (while the current price and historical price path information is still available to participants). Varying the emphasis on purchase price information can manipulate the visibility of paper gains and losses, potentially affecting the size of the disposition effect displayed by investors, as demonstrated by Frydman and Rangel (2014). The order of gamified and salient rounds are randomized, and participants split into four blocks such that half of the subjects start with two gamified rounds, whereas other participants start with two non-gamified rounds. Round structure and timing. To become familiar with the platform, all participants start with a short non-gamified training round (\u201cround 0\u201d) consisting of 10 trials or price updates. This training round is discarded in the data analysis. After the trading game, we ask participants to self-reflect on their trading decisions on different platforms by asking them four direct questions, as given in Online Appendix D. The idea behind directly eliciting participants\u2019 preferences is to gain insight into whether gamified platforms have the potential to improve stock market participation. We purposely phrase the self-reflection questions in a reasonably forward-looking manner in order not to rely on realized (perhaps unlucky) outcomes. Following the self-reflection questions, participants are asked to answer 12 financial literacy questions, given in Online Appendix C. Our quiz questions come from Fernandes et al. (2014), and subsume the three-question measure of financial literacy developed by Lusardi and Mitchell (2011).9 9We drop one question in Fernandes et al. (2014) that is specific to the US pension system since many of our 11 To disentangle between subjective and objective measures of financial literacy, we also ask participants the following question: On a scale from zero to ten, where zero is not at all knowledgeable about personal finance and ten is very knowledgeable about personal finance, what number would you be on the scale? The question aims to measure the self-assessed (subjective) level of financial knowledge, and it is identical to the one used in Cup\u00e1k et al. (2020). We ask this question before the participants start the experiment, so that the answers are not influenced by the monetary performance of the trading game or the subjective difficulty of the quiz. Figure1visualizes the timing of the experiment. The experimental instructions given to participants are reproduced in Online Appendix A. Before the trading starts, participants need to correctly answer five comprehension questions, listed in Online Appendix B. This allows us to make sure that participants indeed understand the experiment before the trading rounds start. Finally, at the end of the experiment all participants are required to fill in a demographic questionnaire.

Each participant receives a fixed compensation of GB\u00a39 (equivalent to approximately CA$15) per hour.

Robinhood, a leading FinTech online brokerage in the United States, shows customers colorful reward animations after each trade. The original animation used celebratory confetti flying across the screen; following widespread criticism\u2014 including during a US congressional hearing on February 18, 2021\u2014Robinhood updated the animation to feature floating geometric shapes instead. Platforms such as Binance, the highest-volume cryptocurrency exchange as of May 2022, and the popular social-trading website eToro use achievement badges to reward trading activity.12 2.Lottery incentives. Some platforms rely on gambling to encourage trading. Coinbase, a 10Seehttps://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2021/34-92766.pdf , pages 7 and 8. 11Gallo(2022) also mentions inadequate disclaimers and disclosures as a form of gamification. We do not study this aspect as it would likely involve using deception in our experimental setup. 12See also ForexCrunch: EToro introduces Foursquare Style Badges , January 25, 2011, accessed May 21, 2022. 13 US-based cryptocurrency exchange, in March 2022 launched a \u201csweepstakes\u201d program where participants can win large prizes (around US$500,000 in crypto) if they trade at least US$100 on the platform.13In Canada, Wealthsimple, a popular FinTech brokerage, offers new accounts a randomly drawn stock worth between CA$5 and CA$4,500 with an average of CA$10. 3.Emphasis on trending stocks. Trading apps often provide prominent notifications em- phasizing stocks with large price swings, often in the form of push notifications on mobile devices ( Chaudhry and Kulkarni ,2021). Evidence suggests that traders are sensitive to such attention-grabbing mechanisms: Arnold et al. (2021) find that push notifications from brokerages incentivize investors to take more risks and increase their leverage. Barber et al. (2022) show that Robinhood traders engage in more attention-induced trading than peer retail investors. Tostudytheimpactofdifferentgamificationstrategies, wedistinguishbetweenrewardanimations and lottery incentives, on one side, and emphasis on trades on the other side. Reward animations and lottery incentives are not stock-specific: by design they neither contain any information about stock prices and returns, nor do they impact the salience of such information elsewhere on the platform. On the other hand, push notifications draw the investors\u2019 attention to stock-specific information\u2014typically a large price swing. We turn to research in psychology, marketing, and computer science to provide micro-foundations for the value of reward animations and lotteries. Following Huotari and Hamari (2012) andHamari (2013), we argue that the two gamification strategies provide hedonic consumption value for platform users.Hirschman and Holbrook (1982) introduced the concept of hedonic consumption as consumer behavior related to the \u201cmultisensory, fantasy, and emotive aspects\u201d of product user experience. Hedonic systems encourage prolonged use of the product, in contrast to utilitarian systems designed to maximize productive use. In the same spirit, van der Heijden (2004) argues that the value of a hedonic system is driven by the degree to which the user has fun when interacting with the product, for example through a focus on colors, sounds, or animations. Csikszentmihalyi et al. (2014) argue 13In contrast to traditional broker-facing exchanges such as NYSE or Nasdaq, cryptocurrency exchanges typically offer retail-friendly online trading platforms. 14 that clear goals (e.g., entering into a lottery or earning a badge) and immediate feedback (e.g., seeing a reward animation right after a trade) promote \u201cintrinsically rewarding experiential involvement.\u201d Dorn and Sengmueller (2009), using survey data for German investors, document that non-pecuniary benefits such as entertainment can explain up to half of the variance in portfolio turnover. The third gamification strategy prevalent in trading apps, an emphasis on price swings and trends, may also generate hedonic utility to investors by improving product user experience.",

        "content": "However, price notifications do not offer clear goals, nor do they provide feedback to investors, casting doubt on their hedonic value. Rather, notifications increase the salience of short-term price movements and therefore carry informational value. To disentangle the different effects of trading gamification, we leverage the in-between features of our experimental design. Participants in Session I are exposed to design elements with hedonic value, but not to those with informational value. In Sessions II and IV (robustness), the gamified platform only displays price change notifications, but no hedonic elements. Finally, the gamified platform in Session III combines both hedonic and informational gamification features. 3.2.2 Implementation on experimental platform Badges and reward animations. Table1lists the achievement badges and associated messages. Badges are earned upon completing a specified number of trades in a given round. \u201cUnlocking\u201d a badge is accompanied by falling confetti, a congratulatory message, and a animated GIF image.

Given optimal play (that is, buy and sell when the posterior probability of the good state crosses the 0.5 threshold), the median number of trades in one stock over 56 (= 60\u00004) trials is 17, with an interquartile range of 14 to 21 trades. Price change notification. Another gamification feature we implement in the experiment is the emphasis on trends. To do this, we introduce price change alerts every time the stock price increases or decreases for three trials in a row. We only display a single notification per stock price run to best identify effects empirically (i.e., such that there is no ambiguity whether a trader responds to a three-jumps or a four-jumps notification; this also avoids assigning higher empirical weight to runs with more observations). Lottery incentives. While some real-life platforms such as Coinbase use lottery-like incentives to increase engagement, we do not implement lotteries on our platform, for two reasons. First, even for small success probabilities, a lottery creates a gap between the expected monetary payoff on the two platforms. Second, we want to limit the number of moving parts on the platform to maximize participant comprehension. Figure2illustrates the different gamification elements. The left panel displays a typical achievement screen, including badges (locked and unlocked), confetti, and congratulatory messages. The right panel illustrates a price change notification. 3.3 Theoretical framework 3.3.1 Investor preferences Frydman et al. (2014) focus separately on two preference specifications: traders either have standard risk-neutral utility and maximize the expected value of their payoffs or they have non-standard preferences such as realization utility as in Barberis and Xiong (2012). We provide below an in-depth discussion of both preference specifications. In this paper, we follow Frydman and Rangel (2014) and assume that investors\u2019 utility is a linear combination of the two benchmarks, to which we add 16 Figure 2: Trading platform screenshots This figure displays two representative screenshots of the gamified trading platform: badges and reward animations (left panel) and price change notifications (right panel). Both platforms include price graphs, information on the current position, total wealth, buy and sell buttons, and a link to instructions. (a) Badges and rewards (b) Price movement notification a hedonic consumption value. This allows us to generate specific predictions on how gamification impacts trader behavior as a function of the intensity of their behavioral biases. Relative expected value (REV). Therelative expected value component corresponds to the utility of a risk-neutral trader who maximizes the end-of-round expected payoff. We define REV as inFrydman and Rangel (2014) as the difference between the expected stock price after the next update ( Ept+1) and the current stock price pt.",

The expected price change conditional on state gatt+ 1is therefore (0:55\u00000:45)\u000210 =E$1. Similarly, the expected price change given state batt+ 1is\u0000E$1. The 17 term (2\u0019t\u00001) (0:85\u00000:15)reflects that with probability \u0019t, the next price change is positive 85% of the time. With probability 1\u0000\u0019t, the probability of a price increase at the next trial is only 15%. Equation (1)highlights the role of beliefs in forecasting price changes. A Bayesian investor expects a price increase at next trial if and only if they believe the stock is more likely to currently be in the state gthan state b, that is if \u0019t>0:5. This follows immediately from the fact that states are persistent. Capital gains (CG). We also allow traders to have linear realization utility , as defined in Barberis and Xiong (2012) andIngersoll and Jin (2013). The main feature of realization utility is that investors experience utility bursts upon realizing gains and losses; that is, at the moment of selling the stocks. The realization utility payoff or capital gain is equal to CG t=pt\u0000ct; (2) where ptis the selling price and ctis the purchase price of the stock (cost basis). If pt> c t, so that investors realize a gain, they experience positive utility. Otherwise, that is if pt\u0014ct, investors have disutility proportional to the size of their loss. Frydman et al. (2014) find supportive evidence for the realization utility model using neural data from traders\u2019 brain activity. Hedonic consumption (HC). Finally, we assume participants derive utility from the trading process itself. Each executed trade generates a positive utility burst \u00150. The magnitude of the utility burst is a function of whether the platform is gamified or not, with gamified \u0015 non-gamified \u00150: (3) We interpret as a burst of hedonic consumption, in the spirit of Hirschman and Holbrook (1982), from trading on an aesthetically attractive platform. To the extent that the gamified platform is more appealing than the non-gamified one, participants experience larger hedonic utility. We do not make the restrictive assumption that the non-gamified platform induces = 0, as it is plausible that participants are likely to enjoy trading regardless of the platform design. 18 Utility function. The discussion above allows us to formally define investors\u2019 utility. Following Frydman and Rangel (2014), we write the utility as a linear combination of the relative expected value (REV), namely the expected price change in equation (1), and the capital gains (CG) or realization utility component. We additionally include the hedonic consumption term and normalize the weights to add up to one. That is, investors put weights !and 1\u0000!on the REV and CG utility components, respectively. Letqtdenote the holdings of the stock at the beginning of each trial t(qt2 f0;1g) and \u0001qt\u0011qt\u0000qt\u000012 f\u0000 1;0;1gthe direction of the trade (sell, do not trade, or buy, respectively). From equation ( 1), an investor\u2019s expected utility can be written as U(qt;\u0001qt) =!\u0002(qt+ \u0001qt) (2\u0019t\u00001) (Prob (gt+1jgt)\u0000Prob (bt+1jgt))| {z } REV (relative expected value)(4) + (1\u0000! )\u0002(pt\u0000ct)1\u0001qt=\u00001| {z } CG (capital gains)+ \u0000 1gamified\u0001 1\u0001qt6=0| {z } HC (hedonic consumption); where 1(\u0001)is an indicator function taking the value one if the subscript argument is true and zero otherwise. In line with Barberis and Xiong (2012), investors experience realization utility only when selling a stock ( \u0001q=\u00001). Hedonic consumption is only realized upon executing a trade, whether a buy or a sell. The parameter !is a measure of investor rationality: values closer to one indicate that investors place more weight on maximizing expected utility than on short-lived realization utility bursts.

While investors cannot be expected to perform the computation in (5)in the short time available, Figure 3highlights a simple heuristic: a run of price increases maps to a higher probability of being in the good state at the next price update; a run of price drops has the opposite effect.

To facilitate comparison between the left and right panels, we separate blocks of 10 trials with a vertical bar. 3.3.2 Hedonic consumption and the optimal trading strategy We turn next to describing the optimal trading strategy. We start from the utility function in (4) and focus on the impact of the hedonic consumption on trading decisions. Buying decisions. First, we analyze the decision to buy the stock. Given the one-unit position limit, investors can only purchase the stock conditional on not owning it already. The decision 14We allow for a positive probability of switching between the \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d states throughout a single round. This translates to a lower state persistence and consequently to more frequent trades under the optimal Bayesian strategy, since Bayesian participants optimally buy (sell) when the estimated probability of being in the \u201cgood\u201d state is higher (lower) than one-half \u2014 as we show in Section 3.3.2. Thus, allowing for state transitions within a round enables us to observe violations of the optimal strategy more frequently. 20 whether to buy boils down to comparing the two branches in equation ( 7): 8 >>< >>:U(qt= 0;\u0001qt= 0) = 0 ; (do not buy) U(qt= 0;\u0001qt= 1) = ! (2\u0019t\u00001) (P(gt+1jgt)\u0000P(bt+1jgt)) + :(buy the stock)(7) If an investor does not buy the stock, their utility is zero. If they buy it, they obtain the relative expected value utility with weight !as well as the hedonic consumption for executing a trade. There is no realization utility for purchasing the asset. The optimal choice corresponds to a unique probability threshold \u0012buy. That is, the investor buys a stock if and only if the probability of being in the good state is larger than \u0012buy, that is if \u0019t> \u0012buy:=1 2\u0000 ! : (8) If investors obtain no intrinsic value for trading (equivalently, for = 0), we retrieve the result in Frydman et al. (2014): investors buy a stock if and only if \u0019t>1 2. Introducing hedonic value for the trading process widens the probability range for which buying the stock is optimal. In particular, investors are more likely to purchase stocks with negative expected returns (i.e., stocks that are likely to be in the bad state). Selling decisions. We similarly analyze the optimal selling strategy. Under the no short-selling constraint, investors can only sell the stock if they already own it, that is if qt= 1. To decide whether to sell a stock, investors compare 8 >>< >>:U(qt= 1;\u0001qt= 0) = ! (2\u0019t\u00001) (P(gt+1jgt)\u0000P(bt+1jgt));(do not sell) U(qt= 1;\u0001qt=\u00001) = (1 \u0000!) (pt\u0000ct) + : (sell the stock)(9) If the investor does not sell the stock, they capture the realized expected value utility. Conversely, if they decide to sell, the investor obtains the realization utility from capital gains (which can be either positive or negative), plus the hedonic consumption .",

(pt\u0000ct) + ! : (10) The optimal strategy for REV investors with no hedonic consumption (i.e., investors with != 1 and = 0) is to sell the stock if and only if the probability of being in the good state is less than half. If investors care about realized gains and losses ( ! < 1), the disposition effect emerges: investors may sell \u201cwinner\u201d stocks that are expected to do well in the future and hold on to \u201closer\u201d stocks that have negative expected returns. Hedonic consumption from trading has an asymmetric impact on the magnitude of the disposition effect. On one hand, investors are even more likely to sell winner stocks, which amplifies the disposition effect. On the other, they are also more likely to sell losing positions, reducing the disposition effect. 3.3.3 Price swing notifications and investor behavior The discussion in Section 3.3.2focused on the impact of hedonic gamification strategies with no informational content about stock prices such as reward animations or lotteries for trading. We also introduce another common digital engagement strategy: participants receive notifications about large price swings. The impact of notifications on trading strategies is likely more complex, as they increase the prominence of particular events on the platform. Our experimental design is well suited to disentangling three potential effects of price change notifications. First, notifications could reduce information processing costs and help participants better forecast asset prices. Second, they might amplify the disposition effect by increasing the salience of gains and losses. Finally, notifications might simply generate hedonic consumption by making the trading platform more appealing. We argue the three channels have distinct implications for the magnitude of the disposition effect on the experimental platform. Information processing costs. In practice, participants are unlikely to use Bayes\u2019 formula to update their probabilities. Frydman et al. (2014) suggest that computing the share of price increases over a recent interval acts as a simple heuristic to forecast the current state. Therefore, participants base their decision on a measure ~\u0019twhich is a noisy estimator of the true \u0019t. 22 One hypothesis is that notifications serve as an additional heuristic to aid learning. When investors receive a notification that the stock price went up (down) many times in a row, this is equivalent to a strong signal that the stock is in the good (bad) state, and they update their probabilities upward accordingly: ~\u0019update =8 >>< >>:(1\u0000\u0015) ~\u0019+\u0015\u00021\u0015~\u0019for price increase notifications (1\u0000\u0015) ~\u0019+\u0015\u00020\u0014~\u0019for price decrease notifications(11) where \u00152[0;1]is the weight investors put on the notification signal. For simplicity, we are assuming investors interpret a price increase notification as a signal that \u0019t= 1and a price drop notification as evidence that \u0019t= 0. If notifications reduce information costs, investors should be less willing to sell stocks that are doing well and more willing to sell stocks that are doing poorly. Using the measures in Odean(1998), the proportion of gains realized (PGR) decreases, while the proportion of losses realized (PLR) is larger. There are two alternative hypotheses. First, notifications may increase the salience of gains and losses. In this case, we should see a stronger disposition effect as PGR increases while PLR drops \u2013 investors put more weight on capital gains. Second, if notifications simply provide hedonic value investors would be more willing to sell both winners and losers (both PGR and PLR go up). 4 Results 4.1 Cohort formation We recruited participants from Prolific, an online subject pool specifically for academic research (Palan and Schitter ,2018). Financial trading apps aim to serve the widest possible clientele; for example, Robinhood\u2019s stated mission is to \u201cdemocratize finance for all\u201d. To capture a wide cross-section of the population, we use a representative sample of residents of the United States and the United Kingdom, both of which are anglophone countries with well-developed securities markets. Prolific utilized census data from both countries to construct a stratified sample across age, gender, and ethnicity. Experimental sessions were conducted on April 11 and April 12, 2023 23 (for the US- and UK-based samples, respectively).",

However, only 22.3% of our participants have a formal education in finance, economics, or management (and only 5.9% majored in finance). 15For each of the two countries, we aimed for 160 participants (80 participants) in Sessions 1 and 2 (respectively Sessions 3 and 4).

However, participants can quit the process at any point during the experiment after being allocated to a session. Therefore, in practice the sample sizes can differ slightly from the benchmark.

Each correctly answered question was rewarded with a monetary payment of CA$0.20 (equivalent to one experimental dollar). Figure 4displays the distribution of quiz scores. The average quiz score is 8.6 points (or 71.6%), with a standard deviation of 2.74 points. The financial literacy score is correlated with whether the participant has taken a formal course in finance (the average score increases to 9.11) as well as with real-life trading experience (average score of 9.41). 4.2 Do novice traders prefer gamified trading platforms? First, we aim to understand which investors prefer to interact with gamified trading platforms. A prevalent narrative is that novice traders are attracted to online trading platforms\u2014is this due to gamification strategies? Hypothesis 1tackles the issue of self-selection and conjectures that 25 participants with low levels of financial literacy are more likely to express a preference for the gamified platform, either because they assign more weight to its hedonic value, or because price alerts have a higher marginal value to them, or for a combination of both reasons.

That is, (1) whether they prefer gamified or non-gamified platforms; (2) whether they feel that they made better decisions on gamified or non-gamified platforms. We recognize that participants may simply prefer the platform design that led to greater success for them. To account for this possibility and estimate participants\u2019 preference conditional on their relative performance, we control for the profit difference between gamified and non-gamified rounds. Table3reports the estimation results. A first observation is that only 38% of the participants prefer the hedonic platform over the non-gamified one, relative to 55% of participants who would choose to trade again on the platform with price trend alerts. In line with Hypothesis 1, participants with low financial literacy are more likely to choose the hedonic platform: a one-standard-deviation decrease in the financial quiz score corresponds to a nine percentage point\u2013higher likelihood of choosing the hedonic platform. Table H.1in Online Appendix Hshows further evidence that participants with high financial literacy dislike hedonic gamification features \u2013 a one standard deviation increase in quiz score leads to a 11.2% and 13.2% decrease in Likert scores for achievement badges and confetti, respectively. At the same time, we document no significant relationship between financial literacy and the revealed preference for price notification alerts. We conclude that price alert notifications are widely appreciated by a larger cross-section of traders, while hedonic elements appear to be more polarizing and cater to participants with relatively lower levels of financial 26 education.17 Table 3: Revealed preferences for trading gamification This table presents the estimation results of a linear probability model dchoice ;j= 0+ 1FinLiteracyj+Controls +error ; where dchoice ;jis the dummy encoding participant answers to Questions 1\u20133 in Online Appendix D: (1) \u201cIf you can trade again, would you choose a gamified or non-gamified design? \u201d, (2) \u201cIf you can trade again, would you expect to make better decisions on a gamified or non-gamified design? \u201d, and (3) \u201c If you can trade again, would you prefer to be given an option to choose from a gamified or non-gamified design? \u201d The explanatory variables include the standardized financial quiz score, the standardized payoff difference between the gamified and non-gamified rounds, the standardized value of the self-assessed financial knowledge, dummies for participant trading experience and whether they took an academic course in finance, the average accuracy of beliefs elicited at the midpoint of each round (computed as the relative distance between the participant\u2019s belief that the stock is in a good state and the Bayesian probability of a good state), and finally participant age and gender.

This 17Table3reports estimation results for linear probability models, but we obtain qualitatively identical results when estimating Probit regressions. 27 kind of behavior may be considered rational and may not be of concern to policymakers. A separate scenario is addiction, where the investor realizes that their financial decisions are being negatively impacted by certain features of the app, acknowledges that the excitement is not worth the financial cost, but is unable to disengage. In our results, we do not observe a clear indication of an addiction channel. Participants consistently prefer the platform on which they believe to have made better choices: the correlation between the answers to the two self-reflection questions is 80%.18To more directly distinguish between a \u201crational\u201d gamification preference and an addictive one, we also asked participants to indicate a preference between (i) being given the option to choose between two designs or (ii) not being offered a choice and being exposed only to the non-gamified design. From Columns (7) and (8) in Table 3, most of the participants opt to be allowed to choose a gamified platform: that is, 66% of the sample for the hedonic treatment and 78% for the informational treatment. Nevertheless, since participants may rationalize their decisions ex post, our results should not be conclusively interpreted as evidence against an addiction channel. Figure5showcases that the intensity of the preference for hedonic gamification is proportional to financial literacy: The average financial quiz score decreases monotonically in the Likert rating of achievement badges (left panel). We do not document a similar pattern for the treatment featuring information-driven gamification: Participants\u2019 rating of price alerts is uncorrelated with their financial quiz score. 4.3 Hedonic gamification and trading behavior In this section we focus on data from Session I, in which each participant experiences a non-gamified platform as well as a gamified platform with only hedonic elements of gamification (badges and reward animations). We conjecture that reward animations and badges yield an increase in , causing participants to trade more on the platform. A natural measure for the intrinsic value of trading is simply to count executed trades in each 18Indeed, 89.55% of the participants who prefer the gamified treatment also state they made better decision in gamified rounds (446 out of 498). Symmetrically, 90.2% of participants who prefer the non-gamified treatment answer that they made better decisions in non-gamified rounds (415 out of 460). 28 Figure 5: Preferences for gamification and financial literacy This figure illustrates the average standardized financial quiz score across sub-samples of participants, depending on their rating for gamification elements.

Hypothesis 2. (Trader engagement) Participants trade more on the gamified platform than on the non-gamified platform.

Hypothesis 2translates to 0+ 1>1and 1>0in the following linear regression model: TradingActivityj;r= 0+ 1dgame ;j;r+Controls +error ; (14) 19See Bloomberg, Trading \u2018Gamification\u2019 Is Huge Concern, SEC Enforcement Chief Says , June 19, 2022. 29 where dgame ;j;ris a dummy taking the value one if participant jtrades on the gamified platform in round rand zero otherwise.

Table4displays our estimation results. Overall, the effect of hedonic gamification on trading engagement is modest when considering the entire sample. The use of achievement badges and confetti celebrations results in a marginally significant 5.17% increase in trading activity (equal to 0.03/0.58). However, the effect is much stronger within the subset of participants who are more likely to self-select into gamified trading platforms.20When considering participants who prefer the hedonic design, gamification leads to a significant 12.5% increase in trading activity. The impact of gamification is most pronounced for those who highly value achievement badges, with an increase in trade execution of 0.16 (21.33%) in gamified rounds compared to non-gamified ones.21 The second part of Hypothesis 2posits that participants would trade too much relative to the Bayesian risk-neutral strategy. However, our findings imply the opposite: on average, participants execute fewer trades (i.e., 0+ 1= 0:62) than expected under the Bayesian expected value strategy. Nevertheless, as depicted in Figure 6, participants who exhibit a preference for the gamified treatment and rate hedonic elements more favorably tend to trade more, even in non-gamified rounds. Our findings suggest the presence of a selection effect whereby participants who place a higher value on the hedonic aspects of trading are more likely to opt for the gamified platform. Furthermore, these participants tend to engage in more frequent trading on both gamified and non-gamified platforms. If each participant exclusively traded on their preferred platform design, gamified platforms would have 30% more trades than non-gamified platforms (equivalent to (0.73 \u00000.56)/0.56). Equation (15)decomposes the difference into the direct impact of gamification and the contribution 20We split the sample based on whether participants chose to use the gamified platform or not, rather than their level of financial literacy. This self-selection criterion is more practical for policymakers as it is easier to observe financial market participation and platform choices compared to assessing financial literacy. 21In Online Appendix Fwe test whether the impact of gamification on trading activity is moderated by investor rationality. We find no evidence for such an effect (see Table F.1), while using a number of measures to proxy for rationality: the financial quiz score, initial knowledge self-assessment, overconfidence in financial knowledge, a dummy on whether price and profit are saliently displayed on the platform, or in-game trading experience. 30 Table 4: Hedonic gamification and trader engagement This table presents the estimation results for the linear regression model TradingActivityj;r= 0+ 1dgame ;j;r+Controls +error ; where jandrrun over participants and rounds, respectively.

The results show that the selection effect accounts for over 70% of the difference in the number of trades between gamified and non-gamified platforms, with only 30% directly attributable to the hedonic gamification elements. To investigate why participants trade less than a Bayesian investor, we further examine their trading behavior. Our theoretical framework in Section 3.3suggests that participants should buy the stock when the probability of a good state \u0019tis high enough, and sell it if \u0019tfalls below a certain threshold. Figure 7shows the empirical distribution of \u0019tfor all buy and sell trades in Session I. Participants who trade less than the Bayesian benchmark (i.e., TradingActivity <1) tend to act counter to the theoretical prediction. On average, they sell the asset after a series of price increases (when \u0019tis high) and buy it back after a string of price drops (when \u0019tis low). This behavior 32 aligns with an irrational belief that the stock price follows a mean-reverting process, as discussed in previous studies (e.g., Weber and Camerer ,1998;Odean,1998). Figure 7: Distribution of \u0019tby trading activity This figure shows the empirical distribution of the good-state probability \u0019tfor buy and sell trades in Session I. The density plots distinguish between participants who trade less than the Bayesian benchmark (left panel) and those who trade more (right panel). Participants who trade more than the Bayesian benchmark exhibit a weaker pattern. The timing of their buy and sell transactions is only slightly correlated with the good state probability \u0019t, indicating a more random trading pattern, likely driven by a larger hedonic value of trading.",

Table5reports the estimation results. We document suboptimal trading decisions for both buy 33 and sell trades. On average, participants tend to buy the asset when the probability of a good state is low, that is \u0019t\u001447:30% (i.e., 50% minus 269.53 basis points) and sell the asset when the probability of a good state is high, \u0019t\u001552:95% (i.e., 50% plus 295.13 basis points). The effect is 15% to 20% weaker for those participants who prefer the gamified treatment, since on average they execute more trades and their timing appears more random. Our analysis provides limited evidence that the inclusion of hedonic gamification elements impacts the timing of trades. Table 5indicates that gamification leads to a 36.28 bps lower bias on sell trades, but only for participants who prefer the gamified treatment (in this context, the term bias refers to a deviation from Bayesian optimal trade thresholds, rather than a cognitive psychological bias). There is no evidence of a significant impact on buy trades.22 Interestingly, our experiment shows that suboptimal trading behavior persists even in the absence of gamification. Participants tend to buy at the \u201cbottom\u201d and sell at the \u201cpeak\u201d as if prices follow a mean-reverting process. However, this effect is less pronounced for participants who have a larger hedonic value of trading, as they trade more randomly and are thus closer to the Bayesian benchmark. We turn next to measuring the disposition effect. Following Odean(1998), for each price update we label investors\u2019 positions in terms of realized or unrealized gains and losses. If the stock is sold at a higher (lower) price than the purchase price, it counts as a realized gain (loss). If the participant holds the stock in their portfolio at the end of a trial, it is considered a paper gain (loss) if it trades at a higher (lower) price than the purchase price. We sum all realized and paper gains/losses across stocks and trials in round rand compute two ratios: P GR j;r=Realized gains Realized gains +Paper gains(proportion of gains realized), P LR j;r=Realized losses Realized losses +Paper losses(proportion of losses realized) : (17) Table5shows that suboptimal trading leads to a strong disposition effect, as investors realize 22We further interact the gamification treatment with measures of investor rationality in Online Appendix F(Table F.2).

(2014). Since the prices exhibit momentum, PGR\u0000PLRunder a Bayesian strategy is negative, indicating that it is often optimal to realize losses but not gains. Consistent with Hypothesis 2, we find that participants who prefer the gamified environment are marginally more likely to realize both gains and losses, resulting in little difference in the disposition effect between gamified and non-gamified treatments. As a check, we note that our results on purchase price salience and the disposition effect align with those of Frydman and Rangel (2014): participants are more likely to realize gains in rounds with salient prices, leading to a larger disposition effect.23 4.4 Price notifications and trading behavior Do information-driven gamification elements help investors by increasing the accuracy of their trades and reducing the disposition effect? In this section, we focus on the impact of price change notifications on investor behavior. In particular, we aim to determine whether price change notifications reduce information processing costs for participants, allowing investors to better time their trades. This allows to disentangle the effect of gamification strategies that convey information about stock prices from those that simply increase the enjoyment of trading itself, allowing regulators such as the SEC to specifically target only a subset of harmful gamification practices and encourage the beneficial ones. Hypotheses in this section are tested using the observations in Session II, in which each participant experiences a non-gamified platform as well as a gamified platform with only informational elements of gamification (price alerts). Hypothesis 3. (Impact of notifications) Following a price drop notification, participants are more (less) likely to sell (purchase) the stock. Conversely, following a price increase notification, participants are more (less) likely to purchase (sell) the stock. To test Hypothesis 3, we zoom in on the tick-by-tick trading activity within each gamified round 23Table5documents that the bias on buy trades is significantly larger in salient rounds (first two columns), despite the purchase price not being displayed when participants\u2019 holdings are zero.",

        "content": "The result is driven by a sharply mean-reverting price path in Round #3, coupled with the restriction that participants hold at most one unit of the stock. Concretely, participants in the salient treatment are more likely to sell the stock and realize their gains at the peak price, in line with ( Frydman and Rangel ,2014). Consequently, they are not bound by the one-unit position restriction and can readily buy back the stock several ticks later when the price drops sharply (and \u0019tis very low). 36 where the unit of observation is a trial (i.e., a five-second price update) indexed by t. We define two notification dummies: GreenAlert tandRedAlert ttaking the value one if there was a price jump, respectively drop, notification at trial t. In Figure 8, we display the average portfolio changes across every tick in the first and last rounds of Session II. We observe significant commonality in participant behavior, with \u201cgreen alert\u201d ticks resulting in selling activity and \u201cred alert\u201d ticks prompting intense buying activity. This pattern remains consistent across gamified and non-gamified rounds, indicating a tendency among participants to buy the stock cheaply after a run of bad outcomes and sell it after a series of price increases\u2014irrespective of whether they receive a notification or not. Figure 8: Tick-by-tick trading decisions and notifications This figures illustrates the average position change, across all participants, for every tick in Rounds 1 and 4 from Session 2. A buy trade corresponds to a position change of +1, whereas a sell trade corresponds to a position change of \u00001. We plot separately the position change for participants in the gamified and non-gamified treatments, respectively. Ticks that correspond to a price increase (drop) notification in the gamified treatment are highlighted in green (red). Next, we estimate the impact of gamification. Figure 9(top left panel) shows that price notifications exacerbate participants\u2019 contrarian behavior, resulting in even greater deviations from the Bayesian benchmark. In gamified rounds, participants are more inclined to sell (buy) the asset upon receiving a green (red) alert than on the non-gamified platform. We examine whether the impact of notifications is influenced by an irrational belief in mean- reversion, using mid-round participant beliefs directly elicited on a five-point Likert scale (as in Weber and Camerer ,1998). To match scales, we map Bayesian probabilities \u0019tto a similar five-point 37 scale. From equation (5), the Bayesian probability is bounded in \u0019t2[0:35;0:65].24We split the bounded interval in five partitions of equal measure, and assign each partition a value from one to five. The accuracy of beliefs is measured as one minus the normalized distance between the participant\u2019s answer and the re-coded Bayesian probability L(\u0019t), Prediction accuracy = 1\u00001 4jL(\u0019t)\u0000investor belief j: (18) For instance, if a participant\u2019s answer indicates the stock is unlikely to be in a good state (e.g., answer of 1 on the 1-5 scale), but the Bayesian probability is \u0019t= 0:51(i.e., a 4 on the \u201ctrue\u201d scale), the prediction accuracy is computed as 1\u00001 4j1\u00004j= 0:25. In Figure 9, we observe a bimodal distribution of beliefs: 44.98% of participant-rounds hold \u201ccorrect\u201d beliefs (i.e., have a prediction accuracy of one), while 39.08% of participants have a belief accuracy of one-half. The bottom two panels demonstrate that both groups tend to buy and sell the stock following a string of price drops, respectively increases, but notifications have a more subdued effect on participants with correct beliefs. We estimate a linear probability model to formally test the impact of price notifications on the decision to sell or buy the stock: dsell;t= 0+ ( 1+ 2dgame)GreenAlert t+ ( 3+ 4dgame)RedAlert t +\u000e0\u0019t+\u000e1(pt\u0000ct) +Controls +error ; (19) where dsell;ttakes the value one if the participant sold the stock at trial tand zero otherwise. The model is estimated over the subset of participants who own the stock at the time of notification. We control for the Bayesian probability of the stock being in a good state as well as for capital gains. Hypothesis 3implies a negative effect of a \u201cgreen\u201d alert on selling behavior ( 2<0) and a positive effect of a \u201cred\u201d alert ( 4>0). Alternatively, if notifications reinforce contrarian trading, we expect the opposite signs. We also estimate the model for buying decisions.",

The figure differentiates between gamified and non-gamified rounds. The top left panel presents average position changes for the full sample, while the bottom panels focus on participant subsamples with belief accuracy smaller than one (left) or equal to one (right). The top right panel shows the distribution of belief accuracy across the full sample. Table6shows that price notifications have differential effects on traders depending on the accuracy of their beliefs. In line with Hypothesis 3, participants with correct beliefs are 35.71% (equal to 0:05/(0:16\u00000:02)) more likely to buy the asset upon receiving a green alert. However, red alerts do not induce them to realize their losses. On the other hand, for participants with incorrect beliefs, notifications reinforce their contrarian trading behavior and lead to even greater deviations from the Bayesian benchmark. They are 31.81% more likely to sell the asset after a positive alert (computed as 0:07/(0:15+0 :07)) and 37.5% more likely to buy the asset after a negative alert. We point out two additional results in Table 6. First, in line with the literature on realized utility, we find that capital gains are a strong driver of sell decisions: a one-standard-deviation increase in capital gains translates to an eight-basis-points increase in the propensity to sell the stock. Second, our tick-by-tick analysis confirms that participants are more inclined to sell and less inclined to buy the stock when the probability of the good state is high, which contradicts the 39 Table 6: Price notifications and trade decisions The table presents the estimation results for the linear regression model dsell;t= 0+ ( 1+ 2dgame)GreenAlert t+ ( 3+ 4dgame)RedAlert t+\u000e0\u0019t+\u000e1(pt\u0000ct) +Controls +error ; estimated over data from Session II, and across participants with different belief accuracy.

Corroborating evidence in Online Appendix Fshowsthat price notifications amplify heterogeneity in beliefs. Table F.3reveals that participants making above-average forecasts at mid-round tend to further improve their belief accuracy in gamified rounds, whereas participants with below-average forecasts become even more inaccurate.25TableF.7also reveals that participants holding correct beliefs no longer respond to \u201cgreen alerts\u201d if the price process is a martingale (i.e., in experimental Session IV). This finding suggests that price notifications enhance learning for some traders and are not solely nudging them to trade. Hypothesis 4. (Notifications and the disposition effect.) If price notifications enhance learning, the proportion of losses realized, defined as in Odean(1998) and equation (17), is higher on the gamified platform than on the non-gamified platform. At the same time, the proportion of gains realized is lower on the gamified platform. Hypothesis 4proposes that if price notifications enhance information processing, they will reduce the disposition effect by encouraging traders to realize losses and hold on to gains. Conversely, if price notifications reinforce irrational beliefs, we should observe a larger disposition effect in the gamified treatment. To test the hypothesis, we estimate P LR j;r= 0+ 1dgame ;j;r+Controls +error and P GR j;r= 0+ 1dgame ;j;r+Controls +error ; (20) where P LR j;rand P GR j;rare the proportion of gains and losses realized on ticks with price notifications by participant jin round r. Table7presents the estimation results, showing that price notifications amplify the disposition effect for participants holding inaccurate beliefs. Upon receiving a price increase notification, the proportion of gains realized increases by eight percentage points, equivalent to a relative effect of 14.3%. At the same time, gamified price notifications do not impact the magnitude of the disposition 25At the same time, we find no evidence that gamification reduces trading noise, as measured by the standard deviation of \u0019tat the time of a trade (see Table F.5). 41 effect for participants holding correct beliefs: these traders are more likely to purchase the stock following a \u201cgreen alert\u201d and do not respond to price drop notifications. Finally, since many real-life trading applications feature both hedonic and informational gamifi- cation, we use data from Session III to study whether there is any interaction between the two types of gamification. Table F.6in Online Appendix Fdocuments that hedonic gamification elements do not impact the magnitude of learning effects or contrarian trading driven by price notifications.

As of June 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to design new rules to \u201ccrack down\u201d on behavioral prompts and trading gamification used by online stock brokerages. We provide several insights into the effects of hedonic gamification and price notifications on trading behavior. First, we observe that participants with lower financial literacy tend to self-select into gamified trading platforms with hedonic elements. Second, we find that hedonic gamification can increase engagement with trading platforms, especially among participants who are more inclined to trade even in the absence of gamification. We estimate that the difference between trading activity on gamified and non-gamified platforms can be decomposed into a 70% selection effect and a 30% gamification effect. Third, we do not find any evidence that hedonic gamification leads to greater trading mistakes. Finally, we find that price notifications help participants with correct beliefs to learn better, but for others they reinforce suboptimal contrarian behavior, leading to a higher disposition effect. Overall, our study suggests that gamification and price notifications can have both positive and negative effects on trading behavior, depending on individual differences in financial literacy and accuracy of beliefs.

Please read the instructions carefully. What do I need to do? After the instructions, you will be directed to an experimental market where you can trade one virtual stockoverfour trading rounds . The rounds are independent from each other and each will last for about 5 minutes. Yourgoal is to trade (that is, buy and sell) in a way that allows you to earn the most money. You can use the information about the observed stock\u2019s price changes to help you decide when is a good time to buy or sell. You will also be asked about your thoughts on the price of the stock: Twice during each trading round, trading will be paused at one point for 20 seconds and you will be asked to answer the following two questions: 1.How likely is the stock to go up next? 2.How confident are you in this assessment? How do I make money? During each trading round you will observe the stock price changes. These price changes (or price updates) occur every 5 seconds. Using the information about the price changes, you can make money by choosing smartly when to buy and sell the stock using the BUY and SELL buttons. The BUY and SELL buttons will not be available for the first 4 price updates. After this initial period of observing but no trading, you will have the opportunity to buy or sell after each subsequent price update. To help you feel more comfortable with the trading game, the experiment will start with a short training roundconsisting of 10 price updates. How do I start trading? At the start of each trading round, you will be given one unit of the stock and have 50 experimental dollars (E$) in cash. Now the trading begins. How many units of the stock can I buy/sell? During the trading round, you can only hold 1 or 0 units the stock. If you already own one unit, you will not be able to buy more: you can only choose to sell it. If you do not currently own the stock and want to buy it, you can use your cash balance for the purchase. If you do not have enough experimental cash for the purchase, you can still buy the stock by running a negative cash balance. Keep in mind that any negative cash balances will be deducted from your final earnings. You cannot hold negative quantities of the stock.",

        "content": "This means that you cannot sell the stock if you do not own it first. 1 How does the stock price change? The stock is either in a good state of the economy (think of economic expansion) or in a bad state (think of a recession). In the good state, the stock goes up with 55% chance, and it goes down with 45% chance. In the bad state, the stock goes down with 55% chance and it goes up with 45% chance. Once it is determined whether the price will go up or down, the size of the price change is always random, and will either be E$5, E$10, or E$15. For example, in the bad state, the stock price will go down with 55% chance, and the amount it goes down by is E$5, E$10, or E$15 with equal chance. Similarly, in the good state the stock price will go up with 55% chance, and the amount it goes up by will either be E$5, E$10, or E$15. The stock randomly starts in either the good state or bad state, and after each price update, there is an 85% chance of remaining in the same state of the economy and 15% chance the stock switches state (from good to bad or vice versa). Stock price changes. Good state Bad state +55% 45% -45% 55% State changes. Good state now Bad state now Good state next 85% 15% Bad state next 15% 85% How does the trading platform work? Over the four rounds, you will trade on two different platforms, in random order. 1.Acontemporary design including: \u2022Achievement badges for executing 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 trades. A trade is recorded only if your position in the stock changes between two consecutive price updates \u2013 for Sessions I and III. \u2022Updated color scheme and user experience \u2013 for Sessions I and III. \u2022Notifications if the price of the stock moves up or down three times in a row \u2013 for Sessions II, III, and IV. 2.Atraditional trading up design that does not include the elements above. How do I know how well I did after the experiment? After you are finished, the computer will select one of the trading rounds at random. This will be your \u201cpayment\u201d round: Your earnings at the end of the experiment will be equal to the amount of cash you hold at the end of the randomly-chosen payment round plus the end-of-round price of the stock if you own it. 2 Earnings =Cash +Stock Price \u0002Hold Stock So, think and play in each trading round as if it is the round that counts, because it might be!

Payment is made through the Prolific platform. Total compensation =Participation fee +Earnings +Quiz bonus B Comprehension quiz 1.The stock price just went up. At the next price update: (a)The stock is likelier to go up again (b)The stock is likelier to go down (c)The stock is equally likely to go up or down 2.If you do not have enough cash to purchase the stock: (a)You cannot purchase it (b)You can purchase it, but any negative cash balance is subtracted from your final earnings (c)You can purchase it, and any negative cash balance is set to zero at the end of the round 3.Your total bonus payment for the experiment depends on: (a)The sum of payoffs across all rounds (b)Your payoff in a randomly selected round (c)Your payoff in a randomly selected round and your correct answers in the post-experimental quiz 4.When is the trade count updated? (a)If your position in the stock changes between two consecutive price updates. (b)If your position in the stock increases between two consecutive price updates. (c)Every time you click the BUY or SELL buttons, even between two consecutive price updates C Financial literacy quiz 1.Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 3% per year.

However, all platforms on our list allow for information-driven gamification elements such as push notifications related to short-term price trends. Figure E.1illustrates the strategies with concrete examples. Table E.1: Gamification strategies on popular trading apps In this table we list gamification strategies, or digital engagement practices, on several popular digital trading apps and cryptocurrency exchanges available in the United States. To select the apps, we use the Motley Fool\u2019s Best Free Stock Trading Apps for 2022 list (updated July 2022) and the list of online brokers available in the United States on theBrokerChooser website. We add three leading cryptocurrency trading platforms: Binance, Coinbase, and Crypto.com, since cryptocurrency is an asset class heavily dominated by retail traders. The first column, rewards from trade , is checked if the platform at any time offered non-pecuniary advantages from trading \u2013 such as badges, points, status improvements on its proprietary social network, or entertaining visuals such as falling confetti. The second column, lottery incentives , is checked if the platform at any time offered random rewards for opening accounts, referring investors, or trading certain amount. The rewards can consist of stock, cash, or products and services (e.g., sport tickets). We do not consider fixed cash bonuses upon opening an account \u2013 by definition, the lottery needs to include an element of randomness.

That is, for buy trades, the impact of on the distance between the \u0012buyand 1/2 is decreasing in the relative expected value (REV) utility weight !, since @2\u00001 2\u0000\u0012buy\u0001 @ @!<0: (F.1) The intuition behind equation (F.1)is that investors who are closer to the expected value benchmark (e.g., investors with better financial literacy) put relatively less weight on the hedonic component of trading. They are less likely to be swayed by these gamification strategies and more likely to maximize their expected value. The result is symmetric for sell trades, since @2\u0000 \u0012sell\u00001 2\u0001 @ @!=\u00001 !2<0: (F.2) Hypothesis F.1.",

To account for the noise inherent in measuring investor rationality, we use a number of independent measures for !to test Hypothesis F.1. First, standardized financial quiz scores are a natural proxy for !, being a measure of how aligned participants are to standard financial theory. Second, we leverage the result inFrydman et al. (2014) that the salience of purchase price increases the disposition effect. In the context of our model, a more salient purchase price on the gamified platform translates to a lower !when participants make selling decisions. Third, we argue that !increases with in-game experience as traders use past payoffs to learn about the optimal strategy ( Feng and Seasholes ,2005). In that case, the impact of gamification on trading behavior is larger for participants who are exposed early to the gamified platform (i.e., in rounds #1 and #2). Fourth, we utilize the assessment of participants\u2019 prior beliefs regarding the stock price gathered at the start of each round. Finally, we allow participants to self-assess their financial literacy at the beginning of the experiment. To test Hypothesis F.1, we re-estimate regression models (14)and(16)controlling for the interaction between the gamified treatment and our various measures for the REV weight ! : yj;r= 0+ 1dgame ;j;r+ 2REV + 3dgame ;j;r\u0002REV +Controls +error ; (F.3) where the dependent variable yj;r2n Trading activityj;r;1 2\u0000\u0016\u0012buy j;r;\u0016\u0012sell j;r\u00001 2o and the REV measure is defined in several alternative ways: 1.the proportion of correct answers in the financial quiz for trader j; 2.a dummy dlow-salience taking value one in low-salience rounds and zero in high-salience rounds; 3.a dummy taking value one if the trader plays the first two rounds on the non-gamified platform; 9 4.the distance between the participant\u2019s estimation of the likelihood of the stock increasing during the first trading period and the objective probability of 0.5, averaged across rounds; 5.overconfidence, measured as the difference between the quiz score and perceived financial literacy. Hypothesis F.1implies that 3<0across the different measures for investor departures from rationality. That is, the impact of gamification is amplified for traders with stronger behavioral biases, whether induced by the platform design, lack of experience, or deficient financial education.

Our findings suggest economically small effects that are statistically insignificant and of inconsistent signs. Tables F.1andF.2display the estimation results for regression (F.3), where the dependent variable is either our measure of trading activity or the magnitude of 10 trading bias. F.2 Price notifications and the accuracy of beliefs In this section, Hypotheses F.2andF.3aim to further investigate whether price change notifications reduce information processing costs for participants, allowing investors to better time their trades. This set of hypotheses is tested using the observations in Session II, in which each participant experiences a non-gamified platform as well as a gamified platform with only informational elements of gamification (price alerts). Hypothesis F.2. (Accuracy of beliefs) If notifications reduce information processing costs, then investors\u2019 beliefs about the stock are more accurate on the gamified platform with price alerts than on the non-gamified platform. Alternatively, if notifications amplify contrarian trading, then investors\u2019 beliefs about the stock should be less accurate on the gamified platform with price alerts than on the non-gamified platform. The accuracy of beliefs is measured as in equation (18), namely the normalized absolute distance between the participant\u2019s answer and the re-coded Bayesian probability L(\u0019t), Prediction accuracyj;r= 1\u00001 4jL(\u0019t)\u0000investor belief j: (F.4) Hypothesis F.2implies that if notifications reduce information processing costs, then 1>0in the following regression model: Prediction accuracyj;r= 0+ 1dgame ;j;r+Controls +error ; (F.5) where dgame ;j;ris a dummy taking the value one if participant jtrades on the gamified platform with price alerts in round rand zero otherwise. Alternatively, if notifications lead to an increase in contrarian trading, then we would expect 1<0. For robustness, we also estimate (F.5)using the confidence level of the belief to weight the distance. TableF.3presents the results, indicating that gamification has differential effects on prediction accuracy. For those participants with below-average prediction accuracy, gamification leads to a decrease in prediction accuracy of 4.08% (equivalent to 0.02/0.49, as shown in Column 5). Conversely, for participants with above-average beliefs, gamification further improves prediction accuracy by 2.15% (i.e., 0.02/0.93, as shown in Column 6). These findings align with the results in Tables 6and7of the main text, indicating that price notifications benefit traders with accurate beliefs, but exacerbate contrarian trading for other market participants.",

(Trading noise) The standard deviation of \u0012buy/sellacross trades within the same round is lower for the gamified platform than for the non-gamified platform. From equations (8)and(10), investors optimally follow a probability threshold strategy to execute their trades: i.e., they buy (sell) when the stock is sufficiently likely to be in the good (bad) state. Conditional on the hedonic value of the platform and the weight on the REV utility component, the threshold should be constant across all trades. However, if participants\u2019 estimate of \u0019tis noisy due to imperfect heuristics, their trading choices will also reflect the noise. That is, there is variance in the trading thresholds \u0012buy/sellthat 14 goes beyond the conditioning factors above. Theoretically, the variance of the threshold \u0012buy/sellreflects information about investors\u2019 precision in estimating \u0019t. Everything else held constant, if notifications help investors to forecast the stock price, we expect the variance of \u0012buy/sellto be lower in the gamified treatment with price alerts. This is because participants are better able to forecast future price changes and to make more consistent choices across time. Suppose a participant intends to follow the optimal Bayesian strategy and would like to buy a stock whenever the probability of a good state exceeds 0.5, that is if \u0019t\u0015\u0012buy= 0:5. In practice, however, participants cannot precisely compute \u0019tin real time, which leads to noise in their trading decisions. For instance, the good state probabilities over a sample of four buy trades could be \u0012t;buy2 f0:48;0:52;0:49;0:53g. Our hypothesis is that price notifications reduce participants\u2019 costs of computing the good-state probability, leading to a lower variance of \u0012t;buy. This argument also holds symmetrically for sell trades and is valid even if participants derive hedonic utility from trading (which shifts the mean of \u0012tbut does not affect its variance).

Disposition effect and beliefs. Using observations from Session III, which exposes participants to both hedonic and informational aspects of gamification, we investigate how the two types of gamification features interact with each other. On one hand, the hedonic features of gamification can enhance learning by better engaging investors and thereby lowering attention costs. On the other, the badges and notifications on the screen might be perceived as distracting and increase attention costs for investors. In the model, this corresponds to the hedonic elements leading to either a higher or a lower \u0015, the weight investors put on the notification signal. We test for these effects by comparing participants\u2019 trading decisions, trading noise, and the accuracy of beliefs in Sessions II and III. That is, we test for a difference in the coefficients between two sessions by including an interaction term in the following regression model: yj;r= 0+ 1dgame ;j;r+ 2dsession III ;j+ 3dgame ;j;r\u0002dsession III ;j+Controls +error ;(F.8) where dsession III ;jis the dummy variable taking the value one for participants in Session III and zero otherwise, andyj;r2 fPLR j;r;PGR j;r;\u0001j;rg.

That is, the coefficient 3is not significantly different from zero for any of the dependent variables we consider: the proportion of gains and losses realized, and the accuracy of prediction. These findings imply that the impacts of the two forms of gamification are distinct and independent of one another. Policymakers should consider addressing their effects separately.

The lack of response in Session IV is rational, as the price process is not predictable. This confirms that price alert notifications aid learning for participants with correct beliefs.

Students did not receive a monetary compensation for the task, but completing the experiment was rewarded with 5% of the final grade for a course on investments. Figures G.1through G.4replicate four key graphs in the main paper using student data. We conclude that our main results carry over to this sample. In particular: 1.FigureG.1shows that the UofT participants who prefer the hedonic gamified platform tend to obtain lower scores on the financial literacy quiz. There is no evidence of this effect on the gamified platform with price notifications.

The left panel focuses on Session I with hedonic gamification elements, whereas the right panel refers to Session II featuring informational gamification. 2.FigureG.2shows that (i) on average, participants trade less than under the Bayesian benchmark, and that (ii) hedonic gamification leads to an increase in trading activity.

The left panel focuses on participants who either prefer the gamified or the non-gamified design. In the right panel, we split the sample across different ratings for achievement badges. 3.FigureG.3shows that participants in the UofT session follow very similar trading strategies to those in the main representative sample. That is, students who trade less than a Bayesian benchmark tend to sell an asset after a series of price increases (when \u0019tis high) and buy it back after a string of price drops (when \u0019tis low). On the other hand, students who trade more than the Bayesian benchmark exhibit a more random trading pattern. This behavior may be driven by a larger hedonic value of trading. Figure G.3: Distribution of \u0019tby trading activity: UofT sample This figure shows the empirical distribution of the good-state probability \u0019tfor buy and sell trades in Session I. The density plots distinguish between participants who trade less than the Bayesian benchmark (left panel) and those who trade more (right panel). 4.Finally, Figure G.4illustrates that UofT students exhibit the same bimodal distribution of mid-round beliefs as participants in the main session. Those participants who hold correct beliefs (i.e., a prediction accuracy equal to one) learn from price notifications: they are less likely to sell the asset following a green alert in the gamified treatment. In contrast, participants with inaccurate beliefs (prediction 21 accuracy smaller than one) are more likely to sell the asset following a upward trend notification in the gamified treatment, suggesting that price alerts tend to reinforce contrarian behavior. These results are consistent with our main findings in the paper. Figure G.4: Trading decision on notification ticks: UofT sample This figure displays the average position change for participants in Session II during \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cred\u201d alert ticks, which correspond to price increase and decrease notifications. The figure differentiates between gamified and non-gamified rounds. The top left panel presents average position changes for the full sample, while the bottom panels focus on participant subsamples with belief accuracy smaller than one (left) or equal to one (right). The top right panel shows the distribution of belief accuracy across the full sample. 22 H Additional robustness checks TableH.1shows evidence that participants with high financial literacy dislike hedonic gamification features \u2013 a one standard deviation increase in quiz score leads to a 11.2% and 13.2% decrease in Likert scores for achievement badges and confetti, respectively. Table H.1: Gamification ratings and financial literacy This table presents the estimation results of a regression model Likert j;k= 0+ 1FinLiteracyj+Controls +error ; whereLikert j;kis the Likert rating (on a scale from 1 to 5) for a given gamification element k: either achievement badges, confetti upon trade execution, or price notifications. The explanatory variables include the standardized financial quiz score, the standardized payoff difference between the gamified and non-gamified rounds, the standardized value of the self-assessed financial knowledge, dummies for participant trading experience and whether they took an academic course in finance, the average accuracy of beliefs elicited at the midpoint of each round (computed as the relative distance between the participant\u2019s belief that the stock is in a good state and the Bayesian probability of a good state), and finally participant age and gender. The unit of observation is a participant.",

This can introduce biases, since ordinal scale labels may be interpreted inconsistently across participants ( Hubbard and Evans ,2010). For robustness, TablesH.2throughH.6replicate the analysis in Tables 3through7, replacing the cardinal measure of financial 23 knowledge self-assessment with a dummy taking the value one if the self-assessment is above average and zero else.

We construct 12 \u201cjack-knifed\u201d financial quiz scores for each participant: that is, we discard one by one the answers to individuals question and recompute the score over the remaining 11 questions. The correlation between jack-knifed quiz score (right panel on Figure H.1) are very high \u2014 always in excess of 0.96. Therefore, we conclude that no individual questions is likely to drive the results. In Table H.7, we replicate the first column in Table 3\u2014 showing that high-score participants are less likely to prefer gamified platforms \u2014 using the jack-knife financial quiz scores. The results remain quantitatively and qualitatively robust.

This paper presents a new and effective methodology for decoding strategies. Given an investment uni- verse, we calculate dynamic weights for a sparse portfolio whose aim is to replicate the strategy with the most stable allocation rules. Naturally, this can be formulated as a reinforcement learn- ing problem whose reward is a weighted sum of tracking error and turnover. We show on stylized examples that we can accurately decode strategies or funds with meaningful factors and allocations. 1. Introduction Decoding or deciphering a financial strategy is a traditional problem often framed as a replication or index tracking problem. However, index tracking is not that trivial even if we have the full knowledge of the index\u2019s composition, due to very frequent rebalancing, churn in index members, and no liquid assets making it a difficult task (Strub & Bau- mann, 2018), (Benidis et al., 2018). Indeed, it is highly recommended to take into account not only the capacity to replicate the financial strategy but also the overall turnover of the replicated strategy and the number of selected assets (Canakgoz & Beasley, 2009), (Takeda et al., 2013), (Fastrich et al., 2014). In this note, we show that we can write this as a graphical *Equal contribution1Ai for Alpha, France2Paris Dauphine University PSL, France3University of the Littoral Opal Coast, France.

Graphical models are a powerful tool that allows learning latent variables efficiently and within a reinforcement learning setting (Levine, 2018), or with complex optimization based on natural gradient de- scents (Benhamou et al., 2019). Moreover, Deep reinforce- ment learning has turned out to be effective for a variety of traditional financial problems (Benhamou et al., 2020c), (Benhamou et al., 2021b), (Benhamou et al., 2021c), (Ben- hamou et al., 2020a), (Benhamou et al., 2021a), (Benhamou et al., 2020b) Let us write (St)t=1..Na time series of observation prices for a fund or a strategy that we want to decode. Let us de- fine an investment universe of massets or factors i= 1...m whose returns for the same observation times as the strat- egy to decode are denoted by by ri tfort\u2208[1, N]and fori\u2208[1, m]. The decoding consists in finding the dy- namic weights wi tsuch that we replicate the initial strategy (St)t=1..N. By replication, we mean that the portfolio in- vested in factors according to our weights and with trans- action cost is close to the strategy to decode. If the value of this portfolio starts at time t0with an initial value equal to the strategy to decode St0and is invested according to the dynamic weights, its value at time uis given by the corresponding compounded returns from t=t0tot=tu. This writes as \u02c6Stu=St0uY j=1Stj Stj\u22121(1.1) =St0uY j=1(1 +mX i=1wi tj\u22121ri tj\u2212costi tj)(1.2) Cost at time tjwill be specified later on in this note. Index difference between weights and returns comes from the fact that weights are decided at previous day\u2019s close.

We can translate the first condition of similar- ities between our two strategies into a condition of minimum tracking error. We are interested in the decoded strategy whose tracking er- ror is minimal. This tracking error is traditionally computed as the annual standard deviation of the difference between the strategy to decode \u2019s and the decoded strategy\u2019s return. Denoting by Std the standard deviation operator and as- suming 252 days per year, the tracking error (TE)writes as follows:TE=Std(St/St\u22121\u2212\u02c6St/\u02c6St\u22121)\u00d7\u221a 252 (2.2) Similarly, we can translate the second condition into a con- dition of minimum turnover (To)whose definition is simply given by To=252 NX t=1..N|wt\u22121\u2212wt| (2.3) We are then ready to formulate our problem as a reinforce- ment learning problem. Although we do not know the solu- tion, we can use the two conditions and create a mix, whose balance between tracking error and turnover is Ai for Alpha\u2019 secret, that acts as a reward mechanism to learn the decoded strategy. In other terms, we create a graphical model that represents all the connections between the dynamic weights and use reinforcement learning to learn these parameters given this reward. 3. Reinforcement learning formulation At time t, we create a state that is given by the previous weights (wi t\u22121)i=1..mand by a window of previous universe asset returns\u0000 ri u\u0001 u=t\u2212k..tand their standard deviations de- noted by (\u03c3i u)u=t\u2212k..t. The goal of our agent is to find the next weights (wi t)i=1..m that achieve the highest final reward. From a graphical model point of view, this creates a graphical model that models the interaction between states stand actions wtat each time, where weights are the stacked vector of all indi- vidual weights. What we observed is the resulting decoded portfolio Our machine learning algorithm learns the mapping from states to actions. This mapping is traditionally referred to as the agent policy and denoted by \u03c0\u03b8(wt|st)where \u03b8are our Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4128693Deep Decoding of Strategies 3 model parameters. It provides in other words the conditional probability of taking an allocation wtat time tgiven that we are in the state tt. Inference of model parameters and the corresponding optimal policy can be done by an actor critic method whose property is to be an effective variance reduction as explained in (Benhamou, 2019). 4. Connections with statistical methods In this section, we prove that graphical models generalizes Kalman filters and HMM models. Historically, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Kalman filter were developed in distinct and unconnected research communities. Hence, their close relationship has not always been widely empha- sized and appreciated. Part of the explanation lies also to the fact that the general framework for unifying these two approaches, namely graphical models came much later than HMM and Kalman filter. Without Bayesian graphical framework, the two algorithms underlying the inference calculation look rather different and unrelated. However, their difference is simply a consequence of the differences between discrete and continuous hidden variables and more specifically between multinomial and normal distribution. These details, important as they may be in practice, should not obscure us from the fundamental similarity between these two models. As we shall see in this section, the infer- ence procedure for the state space model (SSM) shall prove us shortly that HMM and Kalman filter\u2019s model are cousin and share the same underlying graphical model structure, namely a hidden state space variable and an observable vari- able. The interest of using Bayesian Probabilistic Graphical model is multiple. First, it emphasizes the general graphical model architecture underpinning both HMM and Kalman filter. Second, it provides modern computational tools used commonly in machine learning to do the inference calcula- tion. It shows how to generalize Kalman filter in the case of non Gaussian assumptions.",

They provide a natural tool for dealing with two problems that occur throughout applied mathematics and engineering \u2013 uncertainty and complexity \u2013 and in particular they are playing an increasingly important role in the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms. From a literature point of view, Hidden Markov models were discussed as early as (Rabiner & Juang, 1986), and expanded on in (Rabiner, 1989). The first temporal extension of prob- abilistic graphical models is due to (Dean & Kanazawa, 1989), who also coined the term dynamic Bayesian network. Much work has been done on defining various representa- tions that are based on hidden Markov models or on dynamicBayesian networks; these include generalizations of the ba- sic framework, or special cases that allow more tractable inference. Examples include mixed memory Markov mod- els (see (Saul & Jordan, 1999)); variable-duration HMMs ((Rabiner, 1989)) and their extension segment models ((Os- tendorf et al., 1996)); factorial HMMs ((Ghahramani & Jor- dan, 1994)); and hierarchical HMMs ((Fine et al., 1998) and (Bui et al., 2002)). (Smyth et al., 1997) is a review paper that was influential in providing a clear exposition of the connec- tions between HMMs and DBNs. (Murphy & Paskin, 2001) show how hierarchical HMMs can be reduced to DBNs, a connection that provided a much faster inference algorithm than previously proposed for this representation. (Murphy, 2002) (and lately the book (Murphy, 2013)) provides an ex- cellent tutorial on the topics of dynamic Bayesian networks and related representations as well as the non published book of (Jordan, 2016) 4.1. State space model The state space model as emphasized for instance in (Mur- phy, 2013) is described as follows: \u2022there is a continuous chain of states denoted by (xt)t=1,...,n that are non observable and influenced by past states only through the last realization. In other words, xtis a Markov process, meaning P(xt| x1,x2, . . . ,xt\u22121) =P(xt|xt\u22121)Using graphical model, this can also be stated as given a state at one point in time, the states in the future are conditionally independent of those in the past. \u2022for each state, we can observe a space variable denoted byztthat depends on the non observable space xt Compared to the original presentation of the Kalman filter model, this is quite different. We now assume that there is an hidden variable (our state) and we can only measure a space variable. Since at each step, the space variable only depends on the non observable, there is only one arrow or edge between two latent variables horizontal nodes. This model is represented as a graphical model in figure 2. Obviously, the graphical model provided in figure 2 can host both HMM and Kalman filter model. To make our model tractable, we will need to make additional assumptions.

The central dot line is to emphasize the fundamental difference between latent and observed variables We will emphasize the ones that are common to HMM and Kalman filter models and the ones that differ. We impose the following conditions: \u2022The relationship between the state and the space is linear (this is our measurement equation in the Kalman filter and this is common to Kalman filter and HMM models): zt=Htxt+vt (4.1) where the noise term vtis assumed to follow a multi dimensional normal distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix given by Rt.",

This control term is not common in HMM model but can be added without any difficulty. This results in slightly extended formula that we will signal. These formula are slight improvement of the common one found in the literature. Although, from a theoretical point of view, this control term may seem a futility, it is very important in practice and makes a big difference in numerical applications. \u2022We will assume as in the Kalman filter section that the initial state, and noise vectors at each step x0,w1, . . . ,wt,v1, . . . ,vtare all mutually indepen- dent (this is common to HMM and Kalman filter mod- els). \u2022Last but not least, we assume that the distribution of the state variable xtfollows a multi dimensional nor- mal distribution. This is Kalman filter specific . ForHMM, the state is assumed to follow a multinomial distribution. The above assumptions restrict our initial state space model to a narrower class called the Linear-Gaussian SSM (LG- SSM). This model has been extensively studied and more can be found in (Durbin & Koopman, 2012) for instance. Before embarking into the inference problem for the SSM, it is interesting to examine the unconditional distribution of the states xt. Using equation (4.2) The unconditional mean of xtis computed recursively tY k=2Fkx1+tX k=2tY l=k+1FlBk (4.3) with the implicit assumption that empty product equals 1: tY l=t+1Fl= 1. In the specific case of a null control term ( Bt= 0), the latter equation simplifies into tY k=2Fkx1 (4.4) The unconditional co-variance is computed as follows Pt= E[xtxT t]. Using our assumptions on independence as well as the state equation (4.2), we can compute it easily as: Pt=FtPt\u22121FT t+Qt (4.5) This last equation remains unchanged in case of a non zero control term as the control term is deterministic. This last equation provides a dynamic equation for the uncondi- tional variance and is referred to as the Lyapunov equation . It is also easy to checked that the unconditional covari- ance between neighboring states xtandxt+1is given by Ft+1PtFT t+1.

Inference The inference problem consists in calculating the posterior probability of the states given an output sequence. This calculation can be done both forward and backward. By forward, we mean that the inference information (called the evidence) at time tconsists of the partial sequence of outputs up to time t. The backward problem is similar except that the evidence consists of the partial sequence of outputs after timet. Using standard graphical model terminology, we distinguish between filtering and smoothing problem. In filtering, the problem is to calculate an estimate of the statextbased on a partial output sequence z0, . . . ,zt. That is, we want to calculate P(xt|z0, . . . ,zt). This is often referred to as the alpha recursion in HMM models (see for instance (Rabiner & Juang, 1986) and (Rabiner, 1989)). Using standard Kalman filter notations, we shall denote by \u02c6xt|t\u225cE[xt|z0, . . . ,zt] (4.6) Pt|t\u225cE[(xt\u2212\u02c6xt|t)(xt\u2212\u02c6xt|t)T|z0, . . . ,zt](4.7) Under this settings, it is fairly easy to derive the following property that provides the conditional posterior distribution in the forward recursion. And to recover traditional results of Kalman filter, we shall decompose our time propagation into two steps: \u2022 time update: P[xt|z0, . . . ,zt]\u2192P[xt+1|z0, . . . ,zt] \u2022 measurement update: P[xt+1|z0, . . . ,zt]\u2192P[xt+1|z0, . . . ,zt+1] This can be represented nicely in terms of graphical models by the figure 3 below. xt xt+1 zt zt+1xt xt+1 zt zt+1 (a) (b) Figure 3.

This is trivial as the considered state space model is the Linear Gauss State Space Model (LGSSM). As simple as it may seem, the previous proposition makes our graphical model a full powerhouse as it provides the building block to start the inference. Indeed, knowing the conditional posterior distribution at step (a) of figure 3 gives us the first bullet to conclude for the step (b). Moreover, using results from simpler graphical models like the factor analysis graphical model, we can immediately conclude that the second step is given as follows Proposition 2.Conditioned on past outputs z0, . . . ,zt+1, we have the following relationship \u02c6xt+1|t+1=\u02c6xt+1|t+Pt+1|tHT t+1\u0000 Ht+1Pt+1|tHT t+1+Rt+1\u0001\u22121 (zt+1\u2212Ht+1\u02c6xt+1|t) (4.10) Pt+1|t+1=Pt+1|t\u2212Pt+1|tHT t+1\u0000 Ht+1Pt+1|tHT t+1+Rt+1\u0001\u22121 Ht+1Pt+1|t (4.11) Proof. This is a direct consequence of the spatial model and can be found for instance in (Murphy, 2013) or (Jordan, 2016). We provide a self contained proof in appendix B Summarizing all these results leads to the seminal recursions of the Kalman filter and given by the following proposition. Proposition 3.Kalman filter consists in the following recur- sive equations: \u02c6xt|t\u22121=Ft\u02c6xt\u22121|t\u22121+Btut (4.12) Pt|t\u22121=FtPt\u22121|t\u22121FT t+Qt (4.13) \u02c6xt+1|t+1=\u02c6xt+1|t+Pt+1|tHT t+1\u0000 Ht+1Pt+1|tHT t+1+Rt+1\u0001\u22121 (zt+1\u2212Ht+1\u02c6xt+1|t) (4.14) Pt+1|t+1=Pt+1|t\u2212Pt+1|tHT t+1\u0000 Ht+1Pt+1|tHT t+1+Rt+1\u0001\u22121 Ht+1Pt+1|t (4.15) Proof. This is a trivial consequence of proposition 2. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4128693Deep Decoding of Strategies 6 Remark 4.1.If we introduce the following intermediate variables: \u02dcyt+1=zt+1\u2212Ht+1\u02c6xt+1|t (4.16) St+1=Rt+1+Ht+1Pt+1|tHT t+1 (4.17) Kt+1=Pt+1|tHT t+1S\u22121 t+1 (4.18) The equations (4.14) and (4.15) transform into equations \u02c6xt+1|t+1=\u02c6xt+1|t+Kt+1\u02dcyt+1 (4.19) Pt+1|t+1= (I\u2212Kt+1Ht+1)Pt+1|t (4.20) which are useful equations often presented in control theory when doing Kalman filtering. Remark 4.2.There is nothing new to fancy at this stage ex- cept that we have shown with graphical models the Kalman filter recursion. And we can check this is way faster, eas- ier and more intuitive. It is worth noticing that we have also multiple ways to write the gain matrix. Using the Sherman\u2013Morrison\u2013Woodbury formula, we can also derive various forms for the gain matrix as follows: Kt+1=Pt+1|tHT t+1\u0010 Ht+1Pt+1|tHT t+1+Rt+1\u0011\u22121 (4.21) =\u0010 P\u22121 t+1|t+HT t+1Rt+1Ht+1\u0011\u22121 HT t+1R\u22121 t+1 (4.22) =\u0010 Pt+1|t\u2212Pt+1|tHT t+1(Ht+1Pt+1|tHT t+1+Rt+1\u0011\u22121 Ht+1Pt+1|tHT t+1R\u22121 t+1 (4.23) =Pt+1|t+1HT t+1R\u22121 t+1 (4.24) These forms may be useful whenever the reduced form (which is the last equation) is numerically unstable. Equa- tion (4.24) is useful as it relates Kt+1toPt+1|t+1. It is interesting to notice the two form of the Kalman gain Kt+1=Pt+1|tHT t+1S\u22121 t+1=Pt+1|t+1HT t+1R\u22121 t+1 (4.25) Remark 4.3.The Kalman filter appeals some remarks. We can first note that Kalman filtering equations can be inter- preted differently. Combining equations (4.19) and (4.12), we retrieve an error correcting algorithm as follows: \u02c6xt|t=Ft\u02c6xt\u22121|t\u22121+Btut+Kt\u0000 zt\u2212Ht(Ft\u02c6xt\u22121|t\u22121+Btut\u0001 (4.26) or equivalently, regrouping the term \u02c6xt\u22121|t\u22121 \u02c6xt|t= (Ft\u2212KtHtFt)\u02c6xt\u22121|t\u22121 + (Btut+Kt(zt\u2212HtBtut))(4.27) This shows us two things:\u2022Kalman filter can be seen as the discrete version of an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process \u2022Kalman filter can be seen as Auto Regressive process in discrete times Since, recursive equation do appear similarly in Recursive Least Square (RLS) estimates, we also see here a connection with RLS. It is striking that these connections are not often made, mostly because Kalman filter was originally a control problem and not a statistician one. As nice as the Kalman filter equation may look like, they have one major problem. It is the numerical stability of the filter. If the process noise covariance Qtis small, round-off error would lead to obtain numerically a negative number for small positive eigenvalues of this matrix. As the scheme will propagate round off errors, the state covariance matrix Ptwill progressively become only positive semi-definite (and hence indefinite) while it is theoretically a true positive definite matrix fully invertible. In order to keep the positive definite property, we can slightly modify the recursive equation to find recursive equa- tions that preserve the positive definite feature of the two covariance matrices.",

        "content": "Since any positive definite matrix Sd can be represented and also reconstructed by its upper tri- angular square root matrix RwithSd=RtRT, with the strong property that representing in this form will guaran- tee that the resulting matrix will never get a negative eigen value, it is worth using a square root scheme with square root representation. Alternatively, we can also represent our covariance matrix using the so called unit diagonal (U-D) decomposition form, with Sd=UDUTwhere U\u2019 is a unit triangular matrix (with unit diagonal), and D\u2019 is a diagonal matrix. This form avoids in particular many of the square root operations required by the matrix square root represen- tation. Moreover, when comparing the two approaches, the U-D form has the elegant property to need same amount of storage, and somewhat less computation. This explains while the U-D factorization is often preferred (Thornton, 1976). A slight variation is the LDL decomposition of the in- novation covariance matrix. The LDL decomposition relies on decomposing the covariance matrix Sdwith two matri- ces: a lower unit triangular (unitriangular) matrix L, andD a diagonal matrix. The algorithm starts with the LU decom- position as implemented in the Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK) and further it factors into the LDL form. Any singular covariance matrix is pivoted so that the first diag- onal partition is always non-singular and well-conditioned (for further details see (Bar-Shalom et al., 2002)). 4.3. Connection to information filter It is worth showing the close connection with particle and information filter. This is a direct consequence of the fact Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4128693Deep Decoding of Strategies 7 that a multivariate Gaussian belongs to the exponential fam- ily and as such admits canonical parameters. Hence, we can rewrite the filter in terms of the later instead of the initial us- age of moment parameters. This is an interesting rewriting of the Kalman filter as it makes it numerically more stable. The canonical parameters of a multi variate Gaussian distri- bution, denoted by \u039band\u03b7, are obtained from the moment parameters \u03a3and\u00b5as follows: \u039b= \u03a3\u22121and\u03b7= \u03a3\u22121\u00b5. We are interested in deriving the canonical parameters of xt first, at the prediction phase, conditioned on z1, . . . ,zt\u22121. In the Kalman filter settings, the covariance \u03a3is denoted byPwhile the moment is given by xwith the relationship \u03b7=P\u22121x. Hence, we will write the precision matrix as \u039b with the relationship with the covariance matrix given by \u039b=P\u22121. We shall write our new variables to be consistent with previous development as \u039bt|t\u22121and\u03b7t|t\u22121. At the correction or measurement phase, we are interested in the same parameters but now conditioned on z1, . . . ,zt. We shall write them \u039bt|tand\u03b7t|t. We can easily derive the following recursive scheme that is given by the proposition below: Proposition 4.The filter equations are given by the follow- ing recursive scheme: \u02c6\u03b7t|t\u22121=Q\u22121 tFt(\u039bt\u22121|t\u22121+FT tQ\u22121 tFt)\u22121\u02c6\u03b7t\u22121|t\u22121 +(Q\u22121 t\u2212Q\u22121 tFt(\u039bt\u22121|t\u22121+FT tQ\u22121 tFt)\u22121 FT tQ\u22121 t)Btut (4.28) \u02c6\u03b7t|t= \u02c6\u03b7t|t\u22121+HT tR\u22121 tzt (4.29) \u039bt|t\u22121=Q\u22121 t\u2212Q\u22121 tFt(\u039bt\u22121|t\u22121+FT tQ\u22121 tFt)\u22121 FT tQ\u22121 t (4.30) \u039bt|t=\u039bt|t\u22121+HT tR\u22121 tHt (4.31) Proof. The derivation is easy and given in section B.3 Remark 4.4.The recursive equation for the information filter are very general. They include the control term Btut that is often neglected in literature introduced as early as 1979 in (Anderson & Moore, 1979). It is worth noticing that we can simplify computation by pre-computing a term Mt as follows: Mt=Q\u22121 tFt(\u039bt\u22121|t\u22121+FT tQ\u22121 tFt)\u22121(4.32) \u039bt|t\u22121=Q\u22121 t\u2212MtFT tQ\u22121 t (4.33) \u02c6\u03b7t|t\u22121=Mt\u02c6\u03b7t\u22121|t\u22121+\u039bt|t\u22121Btut (4.34) \u02c6\u03b7t|t= \u02c6\u03b7t|t\u22121+HT tR\u22121 tzt (4.35) \u039bt|t=\u039bt|t\u22121+HT tR\u22121 tHt (4.36) These equations are more efficient than the ones provided in proposition 4. As for the initialization of this recursion, we define the initial value as follows \u02c6\u03b71|0= \u02c6\u03b71and\u039b1|0=\u039b1.It is interesting to note that the Kalman filter and the infor- mation filter are mathematically equivalent. They both share the same assumptions. However, they do not use the same parameters. Kalman filter (KF) uses moment parameters while particle or information filter (IF) relies on canonical parameters, which makes the later numerically more stable in case of poor conditioning of the covariance matrix.",

        "content": "This is easy to understand as a small eigen value of the covariance translates into a large eigen value of the precision matrix as the precision matrix is the inverse of the covariance matrix. Reciprocally, a poor conditioning of the information filter should convert to a more stable scheme for the Kalman filter as the he condition number of a matrix is the reciprocal of the condition number of its inverse. Likewise, for initial condition as they are inverse, a small initial state in KF should translate to a large state in IF. 4.4. Smoothing Another task we can do on dynamic Bayesian network is smoothing. It consists in obtaining estimates of the state at timetbased on information from ton-wards (we are using future information in a sense). Like for HMM, the com- putation of this state estimate requires combining forward and backward recursion, either by starting by a backward- filtered estimates and then a forward-filtered estimates (an \u2019alpha-beta algorithm\u201d), or by doing an algorithm that it- erates directly on the filtered-and-smoothed estimates (an \u201dalpha-gamma algorithm\u201d). Both kinds of algorithm are available in the literature on state-space models (see for instance (Koller & Friedman, 2009) and (Cappe et al., 2010) for more details), but the latter approach appears to domi- nate (as opposed to the HMM literature, where the former approach dominates) . The \u201dalpha-gamma\u201d approach is referred to as the \u201dRauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoothing algorithm\u201d (although it was developed using very different tool, namely control theory as early as 1965: see (Rauch et al., 1965)) while the other approach is just the \u201dalpha-beta\u201d recursion. 4.4.1. R AUCH -TUNG -STRIEBEL (RTS) SMOOTHER The Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother developed in (Rauch et al., 1965) relies precisely on the idea of of doing first a backward estimate and then a forward filter. Smooth- ing should not be confused with smoothing in times series analysis that is more or less a convolution. Smoothing for a Bayesian network means infering the distribution of a node conditioned on future information. It is the reciprocal of filtering that has also two meanings. Filtering for time series means doing a convolution to filter some noise. But filtering for Bayesian network means infering the distribution of a node conditioned on past information. We can work out the RTS smoother and find the recursive Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4128693Deep Decoding of Strategies 8 equations provided by the following proposition Proposition 5.The RTS smoothing algorithm works as follows: \u02c6xt|T=\u02c6xt|t+Lt(xt+1|T\u2212\u02c6xt+1|t) (4.37) \u02c6Pt|T=Pt|t+Lt(Pt+1|T\u2212Pt+1|t)LT t (4.38) where Lt=Pt|tFT t+1P\u22121 t+1|t(4.39) with an initial condition given by \u02c6xT|T=\u02c6xT (4.40) \u02c6PT|T=\u02c6PT (4.41) Proof. The proof consists in writing rigorously the various equations and is given in section B.4 4.4.2. A LTERNATIVE TO RTS FILTER It is worth noting that we can develop an alternative ap- proach to the RTS filter that relies on the alpha beta approach without any observation. This approach is quite standard for HMM models (see for instance (Rabiner & Juang, 1986) or (Russell & Norvig, 2009)). Following (Kitagawa, 1987), this approach has been called in the literature the two-filter algorithm . It consists in combining the forward conditional probability P(xt|z1, . . . ,zt)with the backward condi- tional probability P(xt|zt+1, . . . ,zT). The intuition is illustrated by the figure 4. . . .xt xt+1. . . zt zt+1Ft+1 Figure 4. SSM with no observations The graphical model provided by figure 4 can be easily char- acterized. The joint probability distribution of (xt,xt+1)is a multi variate normal whose Lyapunov equation (equation of the covariance matrix) is given by Pt+1=Ft+1PtFT t+1+Qt+1 (4.42) Hence the covariance matrix of (xt,xt+1)is given by \u0014Pt PtFT t+1 Ft+1PtFt+1PtFT t+1+Qt+1\u0015 (4.43). . .xt xt+1. . . zt zt+1F\u22121 t+1 Figure 5.

We get: Pt=F\u22121 t+1(Pt+1\u2212Qt+1)F\u2212T t+1 (4.44) where we have assumed that Ft+1is invertible.",

We will therefore assume in the following that Ft+1 is invertible as this is not a strict condition for our derivation.

Parameter estimation 4.6.1. I NTUITION The expectation\u2013maximization (EM) algorithm is an itera- tive method to find the maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of the parameters of our graphi- cal model. This approach relies on the fact that the model depends on non observable (also called latent) variables. The EM algorithm alternates between performing an expectation (E) step, which provides the expectation of the conditional log-likelihood evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters, and a maximization (M) step, which computes parameters maximizing the expected log-likelihood found on the E step. These parameter-estimates are then used to determine the distribution of the latent variables in the next E step. The EM algorithm was explained and given its name in a classic 1977 paper by (Dempster et al., 1977). The intuition is to find a way to solve the maximum likelihood solution for a model with latent variables. Since variables are hidden, solving the maximum likelihood solution typically requires taking the derivatives of the likelihood function with respect to all the unknown values and then solving the resulting equations. Because of latent variables, this function is un- known and the problem can not be solved. Instead, we compute the expected maximum likelihood with respect to the latent variables. We can then solve this explicit max- imum likelihood function with respect to the observable variables. 4.6.2. EM A LGORITHM We assume that our statistical model has a set Xof observed data and a set of unobserved latent Zthat depend on un- known parameters \u03b8that we want to determine thanks to maximum likelihood. We obviously know the likelihood function L(\u03b8;X,Z) =p(X,Z|\u03b8)given by L(\u03b8;X) =p(X|\u03b8) =Z p(X,Z|\u03b8)dZ The later is often intractable as the number of values for Zis vary large making the computation of the expectation Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4128693Deep Decoding of Strategies 10 (the integral) extremely difficult.",

        "content": "In order to avoid the exact computation, we can work as follows: First compute the expectation explicitly (called the E step ) by taking the expected value of the log likelihood function of\u03b8with respect to latent variables Z, denoted by Q(\u03b8|\u03b8(t): Q(\u03b8|\u03b8(t)) = EZ|X,\u03b8(t)[logL(\u03b8;X,Z)] We then maximize the resulted function with respect to the parameters \u03b8: \u03b8(t+1)= arg max \u03b8Q(\u03b8|\u03b8(t)) The EM method works both for discrete or continuous ran- dom latent variables. It takes advantage of algoirthm like the Viterbi algorithm for hidden Markov models or recur- sive equation fo Kalman filter. The various steps are the following: Algorithm 1 EM algorithm: init: Set\u03b8to some random values. while Not Converged do Compute the probability of each possible value of Z, given\u03b8(E-step) Use the computed values of Zto find the argmax values for\u03b8(M-Step). end while The convergence of this algorithm is given by the following proposition. Proposition 8.The EM algorithm converges monotonically to a local minimum for the marginal log likelihood. Proof. There are at multiple two ways of proving this results that are provided in (Jordan, 2016) 5. L1 regularization and implied scarcity We add in our model a L1regularisation of our parameters to ensure scarcity of our parameters. Indeed L1regularization is more likely to create 0 weights in our model and is quite intuitive. To keep things simple, consider a model consisting of the weights (w1, w2, .., w m).L1penalize the model by a loss function L1(w) =P i|wi|while L2regularizationuses a loss function L2(w) =1 2P iw2 i. When using gradient descent, you will iteratively make the weights change in the opposite direction of the gradient with a learning rate \u03b1that is multiplied to the gradient. As the gradient is not constant over time, we will incur different gradient step. In particular for large gradient, we will incur a larger step, while a more flattish gradient, we will incur asmaller step. Let us look at the sub-gradients to build some intuition in terms of the impact of the regularisation. ForL1regularization, this writes as: \u2202L1(w) \u2202w=sign(w), (5.1) where sign(w) = (w1 |w1|,w2 |w2|, ...,wm |wm|)while for L2regu- larization, this is simply \u2202L2(w) \u2202w=w (5.2) If we plot the loss function and it\u2019s derivative (or (sub- gradient in case of L1) for a model consisting of just a single parameter, it shows the profound difference between these two types of regularisation: Figure 6. L1regularization for a single parameter Figure 7. L2regularization for a single parameter We can remark that for L1regularization (figure 6), the gradient is either 1or\u22121, except for when the weight is nullw1= 0. That means that L1regularization will shift any weight towards 0with the same step size, regardless the initial weight\u2019s value. In contrast, the L2gradient (as presented in figure 7) is linearly decreasing towards 0as the weight goes towards 0. Therefore, L2regularization will also move any weight towards 0, but at a path smaller and smaller as the weight approaches to 0. This intuitively explains why L1regularization tends to cre- ate scarcity in models. This has two important implication for us: Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4128693Deep Decoding of Strategies 11 \u2022L1regularization favors a very limited number of fac- tors \u2022in contrast to traditional methods like PCA, we can use factors that are not orthogonal as the scarcity generated byL1regularization does not imply to use orthogonal factors or to transform factors. This is very powerful as it does not modify factors and makes the approach very understandable in contrast to factor analysis methods based on PCA that transform factors and make the interpretation much harder 6. Decoding a fund We apply our method to decode an existing global sustain- able equity fund whose name is voluntarily anonymous. As stated in the technical section, decoding implies to only take historical reported prices for both the corresponding fund and the factors. We use this bare information to back out the most probable and stable allocations within the investment universe. We apply our reinforcement learning based graph- ical model method to find these allocations. We are able to replicate the fund with a very high correlation as illustrated in figure 9. Figure 8. Decoding efficiency Figure 8 indicates a correlation between the fund and the replicated strategy of 97%.",

        "content": "This is a very high correla- tion indicating that the method is able to clearly identify most predictive weights. This comes with a turnover of 1.39, which is low and confirms that the allocation rules are stable over time. It validates that our machine learning model is able to identify stable and accurate weights. The corresponding tracking error is logically quite low: 3.8%. As we are able to decode efficiently this fund, it comes at no surprise that we have similar annual returns, volatility and Sharpe ratio, between the fund (reported as the strategy) and the decoded strategy reported as Ai for Alpha. This is reported in figure 9. Hence we get 11.7% versus 11.2% for annual return, 16.1% versus 16.1% for annual volatility, and very similar numbers for Sharpe ratio, maximum draw down and return over maximum draw-down. In this specific case, it is impressive that we are able to recover the maximum draw-down indicating that the decoded strategy is really in par during challenging times with the funds. In our case, maximum draw-down, denoted by Max DD, is 64.4% versus 63.1% for the decoded strategy. Figure 9. Decoding statistics As reported in figure 10, decoding gives us a synthetic view of the risks and factors related to our funds. Although it is a sustainable equity fund, decoding emphasizes that this fund has some substantial exposure to domestic US and European equity factors, namely with 55 and 42 percents at the date of the decoding (which is January 20 2022). These two exposures have been quite stable over time as reported by the different columns named Today, 3 month ago and 1 year ago. Likewise, we have a reported Dollar exposure that oscillates between 46 and 48 percents. This indicates that the fund does not hedge the currency risk between the US And European equity geographical sectors, hence a positive exposure to the dollar. At the factor level, there are major exposures to Quality, Growth (short Value) and SRI, which are consistent with the fund objective. The quality factor dominates and has risen over the last year from 32% to 44%, while the short position on value has also increased from -11% to -24% . It is interesting to see that although this fund is labelled as an SRI fund, it has a substantial quality factor exposure which is not obvious when reading the prospectus. One would have anticipated the dominating factor to be the SRI, which is not the case and is currently (as reported in the today column that corresponds to Jan 20 2022) the third factor after Quality and Value (44.2% for quality, -24.2% for Value and 24.1% for SRI). Exposures to the 4 factors Quality, Momentum, Value and SRI are quite stable over time as reported by the graphic below the table in figure 10. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4128693Deep Decoding of Strategies 12 Figure 10. Replication main exposures Figure 11 gives us the dependence to individual factors. As anticipated the highest exposure is on Equity, 83% and leads to the highest correlation, 89%. We can also compute the exposure to Commodity if we force our model to include the BCOM index (which is the general Bloomberg commodity index) and see that there is a small correlation. Dollar exposure is coherent with previous results. Figure 11. Dependence to individual factors Figure 12 gives us some additional information in terms of performance attribution. Decoding indicates an evenly distributed performance contribution between the decline in equities and the decline in the exposure factors for the current month as shown by the two blue circles in figure 11. It also highlights that the fund is manly driven by Equities and specifically equities from the S&P 500, with a styletilted towards growth. This is indicated in the 1 year column with a total performance of 19.2% mainly explained by an equity performance of 19.7%. Overall, we can draw at least various conclusion from this show case example. First of all, decoding is effective in recovering implicit positions of a fund on a selected universe. Thanks to the stability and some modeling factor scarcity conditions, we are able to concentrate on effective factors and avoid spurious correla- tions.",

        "content": "Using this top down decoding method, we can not only see factor exposures driving the fund but also source of performance and identify style change or drift. Figure 12. Performance attribution 7. Decoding a strategy What is even more interesting lies in the generality of the method. Logically, decoding is not limited to decoding funds and can apply to an investment theme. Let us say we are interested in decoding of a macro theme, an energy theme thanks to the replication of the Bloomberg commodity index (BCOM Energy index) applied to European stocks as displayed in figure 13. Figure 13. Decoding of BCOM Energy index The corresponding European stocks are the constituents of the Eurostoxx 600 index. This decoding exercise is inter- Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4128693Deep Decoding of Strategies 13 esting for multiple reasons. It applies to a large universe namely 600 stocks. It tries to replicate an energy invest- ment theme which is challenging to include in UCITs funds. Hence mapping this complicated underlying into stocks makes it trivial to be used in UCITs funds. It captures implicit correlation and relationship between stocks and energy that may seem quite non correlated at firt sight but are indeed related with time-varying correlation. Compared to traditional replication methods, decoding goes beyond. Indeed, traditional methods would can be summarized into two approaches that are very limited compared to decod- ing. Either one use constant weights in her/his replication and hence perform poorly given the dynamic correlation between stocks and the BCOM Energy index and its con- tinuous modification over time. Or one tries to use time varying weights through regression and will incur very high turnover and unstable rules. Figure 14. Decoding efficiency As reported in figure 14, we obtained like for the previous example a very high correlation: 97% with the initial strat- egy and a moderate turnover (7.1) given that it is a long short strategy and hence generates much higher turnover than long only strategies. Residual error is tiny about 8% compared to the strategy volatility of 33%. The match be- tween the two curves is really impressive and translates graphically the efficiency of the decoding method. Figure 15 illustrates that decoding the BCOM Energy in- dex requires long and short positions. The most obvious long positions are quite natural and composed of energy related stocks like the Oil Major Shell PLC. This is not surprising as BCOM Energy and Shell PLC are highly cor- related. The second most important stock is Eiffage which is a construction company emphasizing connections between construction and energy resources. There are other obvious stocks selected like Galp Energia, Anglo American PLC or OMV on the long side. However, we can see through figure 16 that the companies are quite diverse and are spread across multiple sectors. On the short side, selected stocks are less obvious, with companies like Tenaris, Yara International, Gerresheirmer, Rotork Controls, Ackermans & van Haaren, Next plc, Adidas, Powszechny Zak\u0142ad, Franz Colryut, Interk or Barry Callebaut. Figure 16 emphasizes that decoding finds very diversified sectors that are not only related to the energy or more gen- erally commodity sector indicating that the BCOM Energy index has some positive and negative correlation with Euro- Figure 15. Stock exposure pean stocks. 8. Conclusion Overall, machine learning enables us decoding efficiently strategies or funds. The underlying method relies on graph- ical models to capture dynamics among replication coef- ficients and scarcity of selected factors to reduce overall turnover and ensure stability. It comes at no surprise that reinforcement learning is efficient to find hyper-parameters thanks to a reward combining tracking error and turnover. We experiment high accuracy on practical cases illustrating the interest of this approach, with correlations between the strategy to decode and the generated replicating strategy close to one as well as relatively low turnover.

Beyond Kalman filter The proof is widely known and presented in various books (see for instance (Gelb, 1974) or (Brown & Hwang, 1997)). We present it here for the sake of completeness. It consists in three steps: \u2022 Derive the posteriori estimate covariance matrix \u2022 Compute the Kalman gain \u2022 Simplify the posteriori error covariance formula A.1. Step 1: A posteriori estimate covariance matrix Proof. The error covariance Pt|tis defined as the covari- ance between xtandxt+1:Pt|t= Cov\u0000 xt\u2212\u02c6xt|t\u0001 . We can substitute in this equation the definition of \u02c6xt|tgiven by equation (4.19) to get: Pt|t= Cov\u0002 xt\u2212\u0000\u02c6xt|t\u22121+Kt\u02dcyt\u0001\u0003 (A.1) Using the definition of \u02dcytfrom equation (4.16), we get: Pt|t= Cov\u0000 xt\u2212\u0002\u02c6xt|t\u22121+Kt\u0000 zt\u2212Ht\u02c6xt|t\u22121\u0001\u0003\u0001 (A.2) Using the measurement equation for zt, this transforms into: Pt|t= Cov\u0000 xt\u2212\u0002\u02c6xt|t\u22121+Kt\u0000 Htxt+vt\u2212Ht\u02c6xt|t\u22121\u0001\u0003\u0001 (A.3) By collecting the error vectors, this results in: Pt|t= Cov\u0002\u0000 I\u2212KtHt)(xt\u2212\u02c6xt|t\u22121\u0001 \u2212Ktvt\u0003 (A.4) Since the measurement error vkis not correlated with the other terms, this simplifies into: Pt|t= Cov\u0002 (I\u2212KtHk)\u0000 xt\u2212\u02c6xt|t\u22121\u0001\u0003 + Cov [ Ktvt] (A.5) By property of covariance for matrix: Cov(Axt) = ACov(xt)ATand using the definition for Pt|t\u22121and Rt= Cov ( vt), we get the final result: Pt|t= (I\u2212KtHt)Pt|t\u22121(I\u2212KtHt)T+KtRtKT t(A.6) This last equation is referred to as the Joseph form of the co- variance update equation. It is true for any value of Kalman gainKtno matter if it is optimal or not. In the special case of optimal Kalman gain, this further reduces to equation (4.20) which we will prove in A.3A.2. Step 2: Kalman gain Proof. The goal of the Kalman filter is to find the minimum mean-square error estimator. It is obtained by minimizing the error of the a posteriori state given by xt\u2212\u02c6xt|t.",

Since the error of the a posteriori state follows a normal distribution with zero mean and covariance given by Pt|t, the optimization program is equivalent to minimizing the matrix trace of the a posteriori estimate covariance matrix Pt|t. Expanding out and collecting the terms in equation (A.6), we find: Pt|t=Pt|t\u22121\u2212KtHtPt|t\u22121\u2212Pt|t\u22121HT tKT t+KtStKT t (A.7) This minimization program is very simple. It is quadratic in the Kalman gain, Kt. The optimum is obtained when the derivative with respect to Ktis null.

A trick is to remark that in equation (A.9), multiplying on the right both sides by StKT t, we find that: KtStKT t=Pt|t\u22121HT tKT t (A.10) Injecting this equality in equation (A.7) and noticing that the last two terms cancel out, we get: Pt|t= (I\u2212KtHt)Pt|t\u22121. (A.11) This last formula appeals some remarks. It makes Kalman filter dammed simple. It is computationally cheap and much cheaper than the equation (A.7). Thus it is nearly always used in practice. However, this equation is only correct for Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4128693Deep Decoding of Strategies 18 the optimal gain. If by back luck, arithmetic precision is unusually low due to numerical instability, or if the Kalman filter gain is non-optimal (intentionally or not), equation A.11 does not hold any more. Using it would lead to in- accurate results and can be troublesome. In this particular case, the complete formula given by equation (A.7) must be used. B. Factor Analysis model B.1. Model Presentation and proof We are interested in the following very simple graphical model called the Gaussian Factor analysis model. It is represented by a two nodes graphical models in figure 17 X Z Figure 17. Factor analysis model as a graphical model We assume that Xfollows a multi dimensional normal distri- bution X\u223c N(0,\u03a3). We assume that Xis a latent variable and that only Zis observed. We also assume that there is a direct linear relationship between XandZgiven by Z=\u00b5+ \u039bX+W where Wis also distributed as a a multi dimensional nor- mal distribution W\u223c N(0,\u03a8)independent of X. This is obviously a simplified version of our Linear Gaussian State Space Model and can provide building blocks for deriving the Kalman filter. Trivially, we can compute the uncondi- tional distribution of Zas a normal distribution whose mean isE[Z] =E[\u00b5+ \u039bX+W] =\u00b5. Likewise, it is immediate to compute the unconditional covariance matrix of Zas Var(Z) = E[(\u00b5+ \u039bX+W)(\u00b5+ \u039bX+W)T] (B.1) = \u039b\u03a3\u039bT+ \u03a8 (B.2) The covariance between XandZis also easy to compute and given by Cov(X, Z) = E[X(\u00b5+ \u039bX+W)T](B.3) = \u03a3\u039bT(B.4)Hence, collecting all our results, we have shown that the joint distribution of XandZis a Gaussian given by N\u0012\u0014 0 \u00b5\u0015 ,\u0014 \u03a3 \u03a3\u039bT \u039b\u03a3 \u039b\u03a3\u039bT+ \u03a8\u0015\u0013 . We shall be interested in computing the conditional distri- bution of Xgiven Z. Using lemma provided in B.2, we obtained that X|Zis a multi dimensional Gaussian whose mean is: E(X|z) = \u03a3\u039bT(\u039b\u03a3\u039bT+ \u03a8)\u22121(z\u2212\u00b5)(B.5) Using the Woodbury matrix inversion formula (see formula (158) in (Petersen & Pedersen, 2012)), this is also E(X|z) = (\u03a3\u22121+ \u039bT\u03a8\u22121\u039b\u22121)\u039bT\u03a8\u22121(z\u2212\u00b5) (B.6) The two formula are equivalent and one should use the one that is easier to compute depending on the dimension of X andZ. Our partitioned Gaussian lemma B.2 gives us also the conditional variance of X: Var(X|z) = \u03a3 \u2212\u03a3\u039bT(\u039b\u03a3\u039bT+ \u03a8)\u22121\u039b\u03a3 (B.7) = (\u03a3\u22121+ \u039bT\u03a8\u22121\u039b)\u22121(B.8) where in the last equation, we have used again the Woodbury matrix inversion formula (Woodbury variant formula (157) in (Petersen & Pedersen, 2012)). B.2. A quick lemma about partitioned Gaussian Lemma B.1.LetYbe a multivariate normal vector Y\u223c N(\u00b5,\u03a3). Consider partitioning Y,\u00b5,\u03a3into \u00b5=\u0014\u00b51 \u00b52\u0015 ,Y=\u0014y1 y2\u0015 ,\u03a3 =\u0014\u03a311\u03a312 \u03a321\u03a322\u0015 Then, (y1|y2=a), the conditional distribution of the first partition given the second, is N(\u00b5,\u03a3), with mean \u00b51|2=\u00b51+ \u03a3 12\u03a322\u22121(a\u2212\u00b52) and covariance matrix \u03a31|2= \u03a3 11\u2212\u03a312\u03a322\u22121\u03a321 Proof.",

We start by writing down the distribution of xtand xt+1conditioned on z1, . . . ,zt. As \u02c6xt+1|t=Ft+1xt+ Bt+1ut+1and using the fact that the control term Bt+1ut+1 is deterministic, we have E[(xt\u2212\u02c6xt|t)(xt+1\u2212\u02c6xt+1|t)T|z1, . . . ,zt] =Pt|tFT t+1 (B.32) Thus the vector distribution of\u0014xt|t xt+1|t\u0015 has its mean given by\u0014\u02c6xt|t \u02c6xt+1|t\u0015 and its covariance matrix given by \u0014 Pt|t Pt|tFT t+1 Ft+1Pt|tPt+1|t\u0015 Let us now work on the back- ward recursion. We are interested in computing the distribu- tion of xt, conditioned on xt+1andz1, . . . ,zt. Using the Factor analysis model, it is easy to see that E[xt|xt+1,z1, . . . ,zt] =\u02c6xt|t+Pt|tFT t+1P\u22121 t+1|t(xt+1\u2212\u02c6xt+1|t) (B.33) Similarly, we have Var [xt|xt+1,z1, . . . ,zt] =Pt|t\u2212Pt|tFT t+1P\u22121 t+1|tFt+1Pt|t (B.34) But using the Markov property that states that E[xt|xt+1,z1, . . . ,zT] =E[xt|xt+1,z1, . . . ,zt] (B.35) and Var[xt|xt+1,z1, . . . ,zt] = Var( xt|xt+1,z1, . . . ,zT] (B.36) We have E[xt|xt+1,z1, . . . ,zT] =\u02c6xt|t+Pt|tFT t+1P\u22121 t+1|t(xt+1\u2212\u02c6xt+1|t)(B.37) Similarly, we have Var[xt|xt+1,z1, . . . ,zT] (B.38) =Pt|t\u2212Pt|tFT t+1P\u22121 t+1|tFt+1P\u22121 t|t(B.39) Using conditional properties states in appendix section B.2, we can work the recursion as follows:\u02c6xt|T\u225cE[xt|z1, . . . ,zT] (B.40) =E[E[xt|xt+1,z1, . . . ,zT] |z1, . . . ,zT] (B.41) =E[\u02c6xt|t+Pt|tFT t+1P\u22121 t+1|t(xt+1\u2212\u02c6xt+1|t) |z1, . . . ,zT] (B.42) =\u02c6xt|t+Pt|tFT t+1P\u22121 t+1|t(xt+1|T \u2212\u02c6xt+1|t) (B.43) =\u02c6xt|t+Lt(xt+1|T\u2212\u02c6xt+1|t) (B.44) where Lt=Pt|tFT t+1P\u22121 t+1|t(B.45) The latter equation is the basic update equation in the RTS smoothing algorithm. This equation provides an estimate ofxtbased on the filtered estimate \u02c6xt|tcorrected by the convolution of Ltwith the error term xt+1|T\u2212\u02c6xt+1|tthat represents the difference between the smoothed estimate of xTand the filtered estimate \u02c6xt+1|t. The matrix Ltcan be interpreted as a gain matrix that depends only on forward information. and can be computed in the forward pass. As for the conditional variance, we have \u02c6Pt|T\u225cVar[xt|z1, . . . ,zT] (B.46) = Var[ E[xt|xt+1,z1, . . . ,zT]|z1, . . .",

Gallagher** Ahmed Khan*** Danny Yeung**** 2 October 2023 Abstract: Despite much discussion in the ps ychology and marketing literat ure as to how emotions influence decision-making, this area of ana lysis has been largely neglect ed in the finance literature. We redress this important gap by using proxies for emotions drawn from the news and social media to evaluate their influence on investment decisions and ultimately asset pricing. We find strong evidence to support that emotions do influence investor decisio n-making and provide important insights into the nature of thi s relationship. In general, we f ind those positive emotions such as trust and optimism are more influential in shaping investors' r eactions than are negative emotions. Finally, the emotions based on the news media listings have a g reater influence on stock valuations than those based on social media listings.

Introduction This ongoing tension between cogn itive and emotional impulses h as long captivated the attention of researchers in psychology, dating back to Plato, who categor ized human decision-making into emotions, cognition, and motiva tion. Eminent philosophers like Descartes (1989) and Hume (1985) have revisited this struggl e in their seminal work, and the topic continues to be a subject of enduring interest to this day. Yet, until recently there has be en little recognition and consideration for the role of emotions in fi nancial decision-making. Rather t he paradigm focuses on cognition and favours a framework where dec isions depend on three primary factors: human rationality, the information available, and past experiences. This preference fo r adopting a rational expectations framework is understandable due t o its mathematical elegance. W hile this approach has merits, it may not accurately reflect real -world decision-making where ind ividuals face cognitive limitations and time constraints. Recent studies in psychology have shown t hat emotions can complement decision-making by narrowing the range of options and prioritis ing critical decision aspects (Hanoch, 2002; Brosch et al., 2013). Hanoch (2002) suggested th at emotions should not be viewed as an alternative to the rational expectation framework; instea d, emotion's purpose is to \"supplement the themes emergi ng out of bounded rationality.\" (H anoch, 2002, p.1) The failure to recognise the significance of the role that emot ions play in the finance literature is also at odds with anecdotal evidence that shows emotions can be very influential in setting asset prices and their impact on mark ets. The COVID-19 pandemic provi ded an excellent example of how emotions can significantly influence asset prices. Despite the massive falls and extreme volatility in global markets, RavenPack, a data service that ap plied textual analysis to glean emotions from media postings to create emotion indices such as the fear index, was able to show an uncanny ability to predict returns. Thus, theoretical, and r eal-world evidence suggests that we must \"understand what role emotio n plays to have a complete the ory of human rationality\" (Simon 1983, p.29). In this study, we take up the challenge of investigating whethe r emotions impact the valuation of a company's stock and provide the most complete and comprehensi ve empirical analysis of the impact of emotions on stock valu ation.",

Our findings support the proposition that emotions, as measured in news and social m edia, play an important role in Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=44634643 how investors value stocks and react to information signals ema nating from listed firms. We find that our aggregated measure across the individual emotions, Aggregate_Emotion , impacts investor decisions, as do the aggregate of each of the positive and nega tive emotions, and for many of the individual emotions1. For example, we find that some of the positive emotions (e.g. , joy and optimism) increase both the valuation that investors place on t he company and the extent to which investors react to news emanati ng from the firm. Specifically, a positive emotion increases (decreases) the extent to which investors react to good (bad) n ews. These results reverse when it comes to negative emotions, so me of which (e.g., stress and glo om) detract from company valuations and cause investors to respond less to good news and react more to bad news. Our results are consistent with Wr ight and Bower (1992), which show that feelings impact people's subjective probability. People with a positive state of mind ar e optimistic and report higher probabilities for positive events and lower probabilities for n egative events. On the other hand, people with a negative state of mind envision lower (higher) pr obabilities for positive (negative) events. However, we also establish that not all emotions are eq ual in terms of their influence on investor decision-making, with s everal of them (e.g., fear) hav ing little or no impact on these decisions. Our proxy for investor emotions is derived through textual anal ysis of news and social media postings. Research has shown that news and social media posting s provide an accurate and timely record of how investors feel about a specific company and the s tate of the market (Uhl, Pedersen and Malitius, 2015; Sul, Dennis, and Yuan, 2017; Gan et al., 20 20). With the rapid growth of social media over the 20 years covered by our study, it would be inter esting to ask which of the two media has the greater influence on stock valuations. We found m ixed results on this issue over our entire sample. In some instances (e.g., love/hate), we find tha t social media emotions exhibit a greater impact on asset prices. In other instances (e.g., stres s), it is the news media that exerts the greater influence. When we decompose our 20 years of data into three sub-periods, we find that the influence of emotions on stoc k valuations has increased ove r time, with the emotions emanating from the news media s till maintaining, although the i nfluence from that emanating from the social media is grow ing at a faster rate. 1 In total we have four positive emotions, five negative emotion s, and one neutral emo tion (surprise). The Aggregate_Emotion measure is the aggregate across the various emotions. We furthe r calculate an aggregate positive score across the four positiv e emotions and an aggregate negative score across the five negati ve emotions.

Previously, there ha s been limited research on how emotions have affected short-term stock returns (Griffith et al ., 2019; Vamossy, 2020, Cao et al., 2022).

        "content": "Moreover, we show that the association between emotions and asset prices also flows th rough an indirect channel, where the impact of news on valuation will be influenced by the emoti ons experienced by investors at the time of the news. Second, the findings also add to the growing literature that id entify external factors that influence how investors react to earnings news. Studies have shown that t he magnitude of the investors' response to earning surprise can be influenced by external cond itions such as market-wide ambiguity (Bird and Yeung, 2012; and William, 2014) and informa tion uncertainty (Almakti et al., 2020). We add individual emo tions to this list by demonstr ating that prevailing emotions determine the extent to which investors react to news emanating from the company (or relative sensitivity of announcement return s to the magnitude of the ear ning surprise). Third, the study also adds to the scant literature that explain s the contribution of the news and social media in shaping a company's share price. This absence i s surprising as news and social media play an increasing role in our everyday life and, by infe rence, our financial decision-making process. Research has shown that media and social media can: in fluence the purchasing decision (Deloitte, 2008), influence the volume of stock market trading (Peress, 2014) and stock price fluctuations (Strycharz et al. 2 018) and make accurate predicti ons of future company announcements (Bartov et al., 2017). Our results add to the lit erature by showing emotions garnered in mass media and social media provide an accurate gau ge of investors\u2019 emotions that can influence asset prices. Fourth, the evidence that emoti ons influence asset pricing repr esents yet another challenge to the Efficient Markets Hypotheses (EMH ). In the rational expectation s world that underlies the EMH, there is no room for emotions to influence investor decision-ma king. The fact that we have identified both direct and indi rect channels though which emoti ons arise suggests that the impact of pricing is always at the mercy of indi vidual emotions. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=44634645 In the next section of the study, we provide a more detailed ba ckground on the literature regarding emotions' influence on investor decision-making in general, and on financial decision-making. This is followed by an outline of the research questions we exa mine, and then a discussion of both the data and research design em ployed. Our empirical findings a re then presented, and we conclude with a section that provides an e valuation and discussion of th e importance of our major findings. 2. Literature Review 2.1 Background So, what are emotions, and how do they impact decision-making? In layman's terms, emotions are feelings states such as optimis m, joy, trust, fear, stress, glo om, anger, love, and hate. These \"feelings\" are triggered as a psychological reaction to a stimu lus, such as news or a thought ( Yuan and Dennis, 2014). Often emotions are multifaceted and characte rised by physiological reactions such as the sudden increase in th e heart rate, excessive sweati ng due to stimuli, or coping behaviour such as attacking or running away f rom a situatio n (i.e., \u2018figh t or flight\u2019). In fact , if we look at the literature on emotions, we find that emotions have been describ ed as bodily feedbacks (James, 1894), facial expressions (Chovil, 1991), cultural symbols (Ave rill, 1974), and cognitive interpretations of arousal (Breugelmans et al., 2005). Emotions are usually acute and are relatively short experiences (Wilson et al., 2001). For example, emotions can be triggered by someone (e.g., you are angry with your friend) or something (e.g., you regret buying a particular pr oduct). Yet emotions are not e verlasting; once the stimulus that triggered the emotion(s) disappears, the emotion(s) will also g radually dissipate ( Wilson et al., 2000). This short and intense natu re differentiates emotions fr om other varieties of affects, such as moods and sentiment that maintain over longer time periods. Additionally, emotions are \"cognitively impenetra ble\", which means once an emotion is trig gered, a person cannot choose between having or not having the emotions (Frijda, 1986).",

        "content": "To further complicate matters, emotions can often occur subconsciously or at a low level of consciousne ss (Izard, 2009). The cumulative effect of these characteristics may lead investors to make fina ncial decisions based on a sudden surge of emotions over which the y may have little control or aw areness. In the past thirty or so years, we have seen increased interest in understanding emotion's role in economic decisions (Smith and Lazarus 1990; Isen, 2000; Loewens tein et al., 2000; Keltner & Lerner, 2001; Lucey and Dowling 2005; Keltner & Lerner, 2010). Central to this investigation lies the pivotal question of whether emotions sway decision-makers t o adopt markedly divergent Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=44634646 choices compared to those driven by cognitive evaluations (i.e. , standard rational utility framework). Lowenstein et al. (2001) argue that emotions can in fluence individuals' cognitive evaluations of risks, and thus g enerate different responses to probabilities and outcomes. They showed that emotional reactions can influence and may even over ride cognitive decisions involving risk and uncertainty. Moreover, the influence of emot ions is greater in complex decisions (such as investment) that require greater cognitive p rocessing (or thinking) (Forgas,1995). Pham (2006) argue d it is not exceptional for ind ividuals to feel anxious when making a difficult decision. Anxiet y and the fear of regret hav e been found to drive individuals toward making a safer choice ra ther than a potentially more luc rative yet more risky one (Lerner et al. 2015). Studies by Bachar a et al. (1999) and Damasio (199 4) provide further support for the important role of emotion in deci sion making by demonstrating t hat neurologically impaired individuals, unable to feel em otion, make subopt imal decisions. Shu (2010) provided a theoretica l foundation that links investo r emotions and asset prices. Shu (2010) demonstrates that minor emo tional variations can lead to financial market fluctuations in a simple general equilibrium asset-pricing model where time prefe rence and risk attitude are mood factors. In particular, improve ments in investor emotions incre ase asset prices. Our analysis is consistent with Shu's predictions; we examine many emotions exp erienced and how they impact the individual's reaction to new information concerning earning s. The underlying logic to our model is that the emotions expre ssed in the social and news med ia proxy for investor emotions and that these emotions will inf luence the way investors value stocks and respond to the information signals. A common theme of the emotions literature is the employment of a valence approach, where emotions are split into two 'camps': either good or bad, or pos itive or negative em otions (Caplovitz Barrett, 2005). The idea here i s that individuals that are unde r the influence of positive emotions, such as happiness and joy, will view everything in a much more favourable light than individuals experiencing negative emotions (e.g., anger and fear). In this study, we draw upon this concept and divide emotions into positiv e and negative partitions, and then investigate how these emotions impact on investor reactions to both good and bad news. However , there are good reasons to believe that emotions of the same valence can induce different effects on decision-making. For example, both anger and fear are negative emotions, yet they ha ve been found to induce a very different attitude to risks. An angry person is likely to have a greater appetite for risk-taking whereas fear may induce more pessimistic and risk-averse behavi our in decision-makers (Lerner Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=44634647 and Keltner, 2001). Sambrano et a l. (2021) argued that similar to happiness, anger can also trigger a less pessimistic view of an e vent in an individual. Griffith et al. (2019) studied the impact of three different negative emotions (fear, stress, and gloom) on financial markets and concluded that while investors\u2019 fear and stress can be used to predict market return, gloom seems to play no role in predicting the market return. Hence, we also investigate whe ther the emotions of the same valence impart a similar effect on individuals' financial decis ion-making.",

Saunders (1993) fo und that cloudy days bring on negative moods, impacting investor s' trading behaviour, and are associated with lower returns. Edmans et al. (2007) found that t he elimination from the world cup is associated with abnormal returns of 49 basis points. Abudy (2022) et al. study the effec t of victory in the Eurovision context where sentiment is found to be positive in the winning nation a nd derives investors an abnormal first trading day return of 0.35%. In the past several years, we have witnessed an increasing inte rest in the link between integral emotion (direct emotion) on pri ces (Griffith et al., 2019; Vamo ssy, 2021; Taffler et al., 2021; Cao et al. 2022). Using the Chinese stock market bubble as a backgr ound, Taffler et al. (2021) highlight the link between emotions experienced by investors and stock ma rket performance in the boom/bust cycle of an asset pric e bubble. Griffith et al. (2019 ) used a VAR framework with Thomson Reuters MarketPsych Indices (TRMI) data and based on a limited number of emotions evaluated at the market level found limited evidence to suggest that emotions have a small impact on prices. In a recent study, Cao et al. (2022) show that an in dex that measures anger, \"reliably\" predicts index futures return. Vamossy (2021) measured average emotions in the 10 days leading up to earning news announcements and found that high emotions b efore the announcement may lead to a reversal in the announc ement period. The intuition is that investors' emotions are influenced by the leakage of information about the upcoming ear nings announcement, and so the market prices already reflect thi s emotions/earning information . Unlike Vamossy (2021), we argue that emotions are short lived and fleeting. Accordingly, any im pact on valuation will be associated with how the investors feel at the time of the announcement (ra ther than an average emotion level Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=44634648 in the period). We show that the level of emotion immediately b efore the announcement is positively related to abnormal returns in the announcement peri od. Two recent papers have examined the relationship between emotio ns and stock returns by looking at the return sensitivity of stoc ks to emotions (Hirshleifer et al., 2020, Bin Hasan et al., 2022 ). Hirshleifer et al. (2020) found evidence that aggregate and cro ss-sectional return seasonality are at least partly caused by seasonal variations in investor feeli ngs. Bin Hasan et al. (2022) estimated individual firm-level stock em otion betas by employing 60-month rolling regressions of excess stock returns on a market emotion index and found that a long-s hort portfolio of buying high-beta stocks and shorting low-beta stoc ks could yield an alpha of app roximately 7%. While both papers demonstrate a predictable relationship between market condition s (market emotions/moods) and the returns of a specific type of stocks, they do not provide d irect evidence of how firm-level emotion impacts trading behaviour and thus, prices. 2.3 Emotions versus Sentiment Before moving to our data and analysis section, it is essential to differentiate emotions from sentiment to fully appreciate the contribution of this analysis . Emotions and sentiment are fundamentally distinct terms de spite their common misuse in the finance literature as being interchangeable.2 We have already learned that emotions are spontaneous, acute, fleeting and occur at a low level of conscious ness. Sentiment is a product o f cognitive bias, while emotions result from biological processes (Rapp, 2019). Conversely, sentiment is formed gradually through our actions when our instincts ex press themselves the same way. Repetitive action form habits, and the combination of instincts and habit form sentiment.",

        "content": "The reasons that these terms are often erroneously used interchangeably is because few studies define sentiment. As such, any kind of available data has been regarded as sentiment as long as someon e is convinced that these data depict the market sentim ent in some way (Bormann. 2013) .3 Sentiment proxies such as the Baker and Wurgler Index does a re asonable job in modelling this \u201creadiness to respond\u201d nature of sentiment. However, there are several reasons tha t the conceptual differences between emotions and sentiment as to why existing p roxies of sentiment do not capture 2 For a recent example of the fai lure to distinguish the differe nce between sentiment and emo tions see Griffi th et al. (2019), who despite basing their analysis on TRMI emotions data, frequently switch between using the word s sentiment and emotions when discussing thei r findings. 3 There is an evolving literature on the effect that sentiment ha s on asset pricing, wit h a range of proxies having been used fo r sentiment: some based on market and economic variables (Baker a nd Wurgler, 2006), others drawn from investor surveys (Greenwood and Shleifer, 2014), a nd still others determined usi ng textual data (Garcia, 2013). Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=44634649 the influence that emotions hav e on asset valuation. First, thi nk for example of the anger and often frenzied actions associated with a \"road rage\" incident. These short sharp emotional episodes are unlikely to be captured by sentiment measures that are typicall y less granular (e.g., the monthly Baker-Wurgler Index)4. Second, the presence of thoughts and cognition associated wi th sentiment allows individuals to control and regulate their decision-makin g (when compared to emotion) more easily. The studies that provide evidence of trained institutio nal investors being less susceptible to investor sentiment than retail in vestors are a case in point. ( e.g., Tetlock, 2008 and Rapp, 2019). On the other hand, emotions are spontaneous and can occur at a low level of consciousness beyond our cognitive awareness. It follows that immunising decision-ma king to the influence of emotions becomes much more ch allenging, irrespective of the investor's s ophistication (Rapp, 2019). In summary, emotions and sentim ent are quite distinct personal traits, and consequently, the findings from the literature as to how sentiment influences ass et pricing cannot be e xtrapolated to emotions. Emotions and sentiments are recognised in the behavio ural science literature as being quite distinct, the methods empl oyed to measure sentiment canno t be construed as a ppropriate for measuring emotions, and the sta tistical properties are quite di fferent; with sentiment trending over several months while emotions a re represented by short-term spi kes. 3. Research Questions The value of a firm is very much dependent on investor expectat ions of the firm's ability to generate future earnings and the perceived risks attached to these earni ngs. Our proposition, as represented in Figure 1, is that emotions and new information will play a role in determining investor expectations and the value of the company's stock. We test this by examining whether there is a direct link between emotions and company valuation and whether there is a less direct link wherein emotions condition the market's response to new information. Un doubtedly, one of the most relevant sources of information in forming these expectations i s the announcement of corporate earnings. We examine how emotions impact investors' reactions t o the release of earnings by analysing the behaviour of a com pany's stock price around the t ime of the earnings release. <<INSERT FIGURE 1>> 4 In Appendix 1, we provide evide nce to support the proposition t hat emotions behave quite differently to sentiment, with emotions exhibiting very short-te rm spikes while sentiment exhi bits trends that continue for extended periods of time. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346410 One of the two channels we examine is the direct impact that an investor's state of mind has on corporate valuations (Griffith et al., 2019; Vamossy, 2021, Cao et al. 2022). Our model also incorporates an indirect channel, to clearly show how emotions influence pe rceptions and shape responses to new information.",

        "content": "We hypothesise that emotions infl uence our perception and our reactions to news. For example, anger may increase risk-seeking behaviour (Gambetti and Giusberti 2012), while fear may i nduce more pessimistic and ris k-averse behaviour in decision- makers (Lerner and Keltner, 2000,2001). We test this second cha nnel by focusing on earnings announcements as the information source, which has the advantag e of being regularly announced at scheduled points in time by all firms and has well documente d implications for stock market reactions. The fact that stock prices react to unexpected earni ngs announcements is documented in the seminal Ball and Brown (1968) study, first providing evi dence on what came to be known as the post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD). Numerous studie s have since confirmed that the stock price of companies on average underreacts at the time of an earnings announcement, and this is then followed by a continuing a drift (i.e., abnormal return s in the same direction as the initial reaction). Several factors have b e e n s h o w n t o a f f e c t t h e m a r k e t reaction to earnings announcements including transaction cost (Bhushan, 1994); optio ns (Roll et al., 2009); trading volume (Chae, 2005); market capit alisation (Poshakwale and Theo bald, 2004); and liquidity (Chordia, Huh, and Subrahmanyam, 2009). Others have examined ho w market factors impact on investor reactions to informati on signals such as market sentim ent (Baker and Wurgler, 2006; Bird et al., 2014) and market uncertain ty (Bird et al., 2014; Willia ms, 2015). A challenge for empirical research on emotions has always been the search of an appropriate method to measure investor emoti ons. Advances in computing and computational techniques have resolved this problem, allowing tex tual analysis to detect emot ion in writing. By applying the use of semantics to social and news media postings, researchers hav e been able to provide an accurate gauge of human emotions and how t hey can impact financial marke ts. It is very well recognised that emotions and feelings can be expressible in language. Seve ral studies have shown textual analysis captures emotion in text (Munezero et al., 2014). Furt her studies have confirmed the effectiveness and accu racy of these textual analysis techniques in capturing emoti ons (Liu Garcia et al. (2021), Pellert et al. (2022)). Pellert et al. (2022) co mpared emotion metrics derived from social media postings with self-reported emotions from the UK's YouGov survey. They found a high correlation between the text ual analysis-based measures of emotions and self-reported feelings of YouGov. Adding furthe r merit to these textual analy sis derived emotions measures, Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346411 Garcia et al. (2021) showed when combined with user demographic data, emotions derived from advanced text analysis methods p rovide an accurate gauge of emo tions in the general population. In this study, we employ nine emo tions indices generated by TRM I data derived from the textual analysis of both news and social media postings. The underlying logic to our model is that the emotions expressed in the social and news media proxy for inves tor emotions, which will influence the way investors value stocks and respond to the information s ignals. In our case, that information that we consider is ea rnings announcements. We propose that emotions expressed significantly impact investo r decision-making and this proposition forms the basis of ou r first research questions. Question 1: Do the emotions expressed in the news and social me dia affect the decision- making of investors? We break this down into two sub-questions: Question 1a: Is there a direct relationship between each of the individual emotions, and their aggregate, emanating from the news and social media and t he market valuation of a company? Question 1b: Do each of the individual emotions, and their aggr egate, emanating from the news and social media impact on how investors respond to new in formation (earnings announcements)? Since TRMI source information from News and Social media postin gs, it allows us to examine the relative importance of these media outlets.",

Data Our sample period extends from the beginning of 1998 to the end of 2017, with the universe being restricted to stocks listed on th e S&P500 The information regar ding actual earnings and financial analysts' earnings forecasts for each stock is gathered from th e I/B/E/S database. The accounting data, including reported earnings, is obtained from the CRSP/CO MPUSTAT merged database and sourced through WRDS. WRDS is th e source of the equity market's CRPS return and price data. We acquired the Implied Volatility Index (VIX) data for the mar ket from the CBOE. In line with prior literature, we have winsorised the character istics for each stock at the 1st and 99th percentiles to eliminate outlier s' impact. In addition to being a member of the S&P500, we have also applied a set of stringent criteria to determine the eligi bility of firms for inclusion in our sample: 1) The price of the share, as repor ted in Compustat, had to be gre ater than $1. 2) To eliminate the firms with low liquidity, we include only thos e with a market (book) value greater than $5 million at th e end of quarter \"t-1\". 3) Daily returns are available on CRSP from \"t-1\" to \"t+1\", where \"t0\" is the announcement day. 4) The earnings announcement date is reported both in I/B/E/S and Compustat. To be included in the sample, the difference between the I/B/E/S report date a nd Compustat report date should not be more than one calendar day. 5) Firms that did not have any analysts' earnings forecast data we re also removed.

A significant advantage of utilising this distinctive dataset, sourced from a reputable professional data provider, is that it does not suffer from the limitations of other textual analysis data deri ved from a restricted range of media sources, a narrow set of assets, and truncated sample periods. Several studies have already confirmed the effectiveness and accuracy of this database. For example, Michaelides et al. (2015) found that variation of the TRMI metrics matched the data of ma nually collected sovereign downgrade news. In a separate study, Michaelides et al.

Each posting on these sites is screened to determine its financ ial relevance to the company to which it relates. If it passes this filter, the posting is processed using the TRMI's linguistic so ftware to determine how much (if anything) it contributes towards t he score for each company and for each of the emotions. The result of this process is that we have a score for each of the nine emotions calculated on a minute- by-minute basis from each social media and the traditional news media. The TRMI emotion scores are bipolar (-1 to 1) or unipolar (0 to 1). For example, Optimism is bipolar as it can take on positive or negative values, while Jo y is unipolar as it can only be positive. Table 1 provides an overview of all the emotions utilised in th e study. There are also some instances when we must deal with the missing values of emotions , which occur when there is no observation at a particular time for a specific emotion. Follow ing Ryan and Giles (1999), we have addressed the issue of missing values by using a technique of c arrying forward the previous observation. As discus sed earlier, we source nine different pos itive and negative emotions from TRMI. We calculate the aggregate positive and negative emotions based on a group of positive/negative emotions. For the Aggregate Positive emotion score of firm 'i' on day 't', we take 5 https://a-teaminsight.com/blog/thomson-reuters-adds-sentiment- data-on-companies-to-its-marketpsych-indices/ 6 There are 34 indices of emotion in the Thomson Reuters MarketP ysch Index (TRMI) database. We have chosen nine of these emotion indices in our study based on evidence from past litera ture indicating that these emotions are most likely to influenc e decision-making. For example, we included anger as Lerner and K elter (2000) show that ange r and fear can influence individuals\u2019 risk preferences. Th e authors found that anger ten ds caused individuals to be more risk-taking, while fear tends to make individuals more risk-a verse in making decisions. 7 Thomson Reuters claims that the TRMI index covers 30% of all s ocial media sources. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346414 the average score of Optimism, Joy, Trust, and Love/Hate. We re move any observations with less than two positive emotions to make up the aggregate positive em otion. Similarly, for the Aggregate Negative emotion score of firm 'i ' on day 't', is the average s core of Stress, Gloom, Fear, Anger, Conflict, and Violence. Finally, the Aggregate Emotions score i s t h e s u m o f t h e s c o r e f o r Aggregate Positive and Aggregate Negative. For this study, we use the daily data (window length) which is updated on an hourly basis and represents the score over the previous 24 hours. For example, o ne series of TRMI scores for \"emotion\" relates to the data collected between 4 pm (market cl ose) on January 10th, 2008, and 4 pm on January 11th, 2008. The next set of scores for \"emotion\" would be based on the data collected between 5 pm on January 10th, 2008, and 5 pm on January 11th, 2008. Our emotion measure for each emotion is the score as at 4 pm each day measu red over the previous 24 hours. 5. Research Design In our analysis, we study the behaviour of a company's stock at the time of the release of its earnings report. We define t = 0 as the day of the earnings ann ouncement8 Consistent with standard practice in the literature, we use a two-day window (t=0 and t= +1) to calculate the returns over the announcement period. The basic model which we use t o study the impact of an earnings announcement on stock returns is: \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc45 \u0bdc,\u0be7 \u0d4c\ud835\udefc\u0d45\ud835\udefd \u0b35\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc38 \u0bdc,\u0be7\u0d45\ud835\udefd \u0b36\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5b\u123a\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc49\u123b \u0bdc,\u0be7\u0d45\ud835\udefd \u0b37\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\u123a\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc40\u123b \u0bdc,\u0be7\u0d45\ud835\udefd \u0b38\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e \u0bdc,\u0be7\u0d45\ud835\udefd \u0b39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc444 \u0bdc,\u0be7\u0d45\ud835\udefd \u0b3a\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 \u0bdc,\u0be7\u0d45 \ud835\udefd\u0b3b\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc4b \u0bdc,\u0be7\u0d45\ud835\udefd \u0b3c\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc66 \u0bdc,\u0be7\u0d45\ud835\udefd \u0b3d\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59 \u0bdc,\u0be7\u0d45\ud835\udefd \u0b35\u0b34\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc40 \u0bdc,\u0be7\u0d45 \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc44 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 \u0d45 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 \u0d45 \ud835\udf00 \u0bdc,\u0be7 \u2026.

We further divide our sample base d on good and bad earnings news. Thus, we have Positive Unexpected Earnings (PUE) when the actual earnings per share ar e greater than the expected earnings. At the same time, we have Negative Unexpected Earning s (NUE) when the actual earnings per share are less than expected.10 We include numerous control variables in our study chosen becau se they have been found in previous studies to be correlated with returns. These include f irm size (Bernard and Thomas, 1989), earnings volatility and book-to -market (Hirshleifer, Lim , and Teoh, 2009), Friday (Hung, Li, and Wang, 2014) , beta and loss (DeFond, Hung, and Trezevant , 2007), FQ4 (S un, 2015), VIX (Bird et al., 2014), and momentum (Boehmer and Wu, 2013). We de fine each of the nine control variables as follows: 1. Ln of Market Value (MV ): Ln of Market Cap italization at the end of quarter t-1. 2. Log (Book-to-Market): The logarithm of book-to-market (BTM) ratio, calculated at the end of each June based on the book value of equity for the last fiscal year-end in the previous calendar year divided by the market value of equity fo r December of the previous calendar year. 3. Beta : Estimate on market returns in a market model regression for f irms with daily returns in the 250 trading days before the earnings announcement. Obser vations which had less than 100 trading days for e stimation were dropped. 4. FQ4: A dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the announcement is of the fourth- fiscal quarter, otherwise its value is 0. 9 We also scale the unexpected earnings by price and by median c onsensus analysts' forecast. H owever, the results are chosen because they have been found to be quantitatively similar. 10 In instances when the actual earnings per share are equal to t he expected (i.e., no surprise), and in these cases, we place t he observation in the PUE subsample. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346416 5. Loss: A dummy variable which takes the value of 1 if the I/B/E/S valu e of actual EPS is negative, otherwise its value is 0. 6. Implied volatility index (VIX): It is a measure used to track volatility on the S&P 500 index and is the most well-known volatility index on the market s. 7. Friday : A dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the announcemen t was made on Friday, otherwise its value is 0. 8. Evol: Earnings volatility, calculated as the standard deviation duri ng the preceding four years of the variations of quart erly earnings from one-year-ago earnings (minimum 4 observations required). 9. Momentum: Our measure of momentum is the abnormal return measured over t he five trading days prior to the earnings announcement. Another issue with our analysis relates to the existence of a p otential causality loop between emotion and returns. The inclusi on of the momentum in our analy sis serves to addr ess a potential endogeneity issue (Leszczensky and Wolbring, 2019). We note tha t the inclusion of the momentum variable did not alter a ny of the results of the analy sis.",

Further, we have also added the fiscal quarter effects (FQ effe cts) to account for the heterogeneity in price reactions over time. We have also added the sector eff ects to isolate within sector variations. For example, if a se ctor usually tends to have posi tive unexpected earnings, then adding sector effects will rule out that this drives our results. The literature suggests that the OLS standard errors can be biased and poten tially can under(over) estimate t he true variability of the coefficient estimates. To address this issu e, and make our model more robus t, we follow Petersen (2009) and cluster the standard errors by firms because there is a potenti al that the standard errors might be correlated over time a t the firm level. We next divide our sample into g roups of good news and bad news . To find out the relationship between positive earnings surprise (PUE) and negative earnings surprise (NUE) with abnormal returns, we expand Equation 1 to incorporate the separation of PUE and NUE.

Similarly, PUE is calculated by multiplying the unexpected earning by a dummy variable which ta kes the value of 1 if there is a positive earnings surprise, and 0 otherwise.

A summary of the variables incl uded in our analysis is set out in Table 1. An analysis of this data that PUE represents about 75% of the sample, but the magnitude of NUE is about twice that of PUE11. However, we also see that the standard deviation of NUE is mu ch higher than the standard deviation of PUE. Our analysis further suggests no significant difference exists between the level of emotion emanating from social media and the level of the new s media. There is undoubtedly more Joy and Love/Hate generated by social media, although this is somewhat balanced because Gloom and Anger are also slightly higher for social media. Over all, this suggests that social media is more likely to witness more e xtreme expressions of emotions. <<INSERT TABLE 1>> 6. Empirical Results This section presents our resea rch results on the impact of new s and social media emotions on company valuation. Our study invest igates the direct effect and how the market responds to information disseminated by the company. Market Reaction As the first step towards investigating whether emotions impact the way investors respond to new information, we first need to es tablish that the new informatio n affects a company's share price. To analyse this, we applied Equation 1 to our data, and we repo rted in Table 2 (Panel A). The coefficient reported for unexpected earnings ( \ud835\udefd \u0b35=0.024***) clearly indicates a significant reaction to the earnings announcement (i.e., good news has a positive im pact on the value of a company, 11 The detail of this da ta summary is available from the authors. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346419 and bad news has a negative impact)12. The sign of the coefficient att ached to each control variable is generally as expected. For example, a size and value effect is apparent in the announcement period. There is also a noticeable Friday effect where abnormal r e t u r n s a r e l o w e r w h e r e t h e announcement occurs on a Friday. Interestingly, the coefficient associated with our momentum measure suggests a reversal in the announcement period. This re turn reversal is consistent with Vamossy (2021) findings, which document a similar return turnar ound in the announcement period. Next, we apply Eq. 2 to our data to separate our unexpected ear nings into bad news (NUE) and good news (PUE). The coefficients reported in Table 2 (Panel B) for NUE (\u03b2_1=0.017***) and PUE (\u03b2_2=0.034***) confirm that the investors react to both neg ative and positive news, with the response being twice as great for a quantum of good news than i t is for a quantum of bad news.",

        "content": "On balance, this finding is consis tent with that of most other papers (e.g., Lu et al., 2013) <<INSERT TABLE 2>> Market Reaction to Emotions While many studies have attempted to use firm-level characteris tics to explain the investor reaction at the time of earnings announcements, few have investigated th e impact of emotions on the relationship between earnings ann ouncements and stock price adj ustment (Vamossy, 2021, Griffith et al., 2019). In this study, we investigate the exten t to which a wide range of emotions plays a role in determining a sset values directly or through th e market response to the release of new information. Through this a pproach, we can effectively meas ure how emotions, as captured by news and social media coverage , affect investor decision-mak ing. We estimate Equation 3 using data on our nine individual emotions measured at the comp any level and derived from the social media, the news media, and these two media sources combi ned. As indicated in Table 1, we divided the various emotions into four positive and five negati ve emotions. We have also calculated aggregate positive emotions, which is the aggregatio n of the four positive emotions, 12 It must be recognised that the values for NUE are negative and so a positive coefficient informs us that NUE has a negative impact on the value of a company. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346420 and aggregate negative emotions, which is the composite of the five negative emotions. Finally, we added the aggregate positive emotion score, and the aggregat e negative emotions score to obtain the grand composite score, Aggregate_Emotions . We conduct our analysis following a top-down approach commencin g with an investigation into how Aggregate_Emotion, the composite of positive and negative e motions, impacts market valuations. We next examine the positive component and the nega tive component of the Aggregate_Emotion score separately. As a final step, we examine how each of the nine individual emotions impact company valuati ons. Through this rigorous analy tical framework, we can explore in depth the emotional drivers of investor behaviour and undert ake a more thorough analysis of emotions' role in influenci ng investor decision-making and asse t prices. Aggregate_Emotion Our equivalent is Aggregate_Emotion is a composite of nine different emotions drawn from the TRMI database. Aggregate_Emotion has advantages in terms of the frequency of calculation, the length of the data series, and th e breadth of the media sources that are analysed (Peterson, 2016). From our findings reported in Tab le 3 (Panel A), we observe tha t both the level (FEt-1) of, and change (\u2206FEt-1 to 1) in, the Aggregate_Emotion score have a direct impact on returns. We see a higher Aggregate_Emotion score and an increase in the score, both translating to higher share prices. The results confirm that market valuations are influenc ed by emotions generated by postings in both the news and social media. However, of the two , it is the Aggregate_Emotion proxied by listings on the news media that has, by far, the gre ater direct impact on market valuations. We previously observed that a negative earnings surprise typica lly harms stock prices (NUE = 0.017*** from Table 2, Panel B). We expect that when Aggregate_Emotion is high (which we Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346421 define as high, and increasing, Aggregate_Emotion ), this will cause investors to take a more positive stance when interpreting bad news and so result in a s maller adverse market reaction to this news. Consistent with these expectations, we see that when Aggregate_Emotion , as calculated from the news and social media combined, is at a high level at the time of the release of negative earnings news, the magnitude of the adverse reaction is much lo wer than average (NUE = 0.012** < 0.017***). However, when a negative earnings surprise occurs at a time when Aggregate_Emotion is low, the market response is more significant than is typica lly the case (NUE = 0.021*** > 0.017***).",

        "content": "Consistent with expectations, our analy sis shows that a negative earnings surprise leads to a downward revision of a company's stock pric e. We find that the magnitude of this downward adjustment is re latively less pronounced when neg ative earnings a re announced at a time of high Aggregate_Emotions. However, it is worth noting that the observed difference in the degree of adjustment is st atistically insignificant. We see from Table 2 Panel B that the coefficient for PUE across the whole sample is 0.034***, which confirms that on average, there is a positive reaction to a positive earnings surprise. In relation to Table 3 (Panel A), when we look at the coefficient for PUE associated with earnings releases made at a time when sentiment is high, we see a market reaction that is much greater than what we reported earlier (PUE = 0.058** > 0.034***). Again, thi s finding is very much consistent with our expectation that good news released by a company will have a more positive impact on market prices if it becomes available at a time when emotions a re very positive. However, if we look at the market reaction to good earnings news released when Aggregate_Emotion is low, we see that the market reaction is much lower than it is in more t ypical times (PUE = 0.008 < 0.034***). Indeed, we find that inve stors effectively ignore go od earnings news released at a time when Aggregate_Emotion is low as the earnings news has no signi ficant impact on stock prices. Further, the difference in the impact of the positive announcem ents over the announcement period between when Aggregate_Emotion is high and when it is low (0.050***) is highly significant, Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346422 demonstrating that emotions have a significant impact on how in vestors respond to good earnings announcements. To summarise, we find strong evidence to suggest that both the level of, and movements in the level of, Aggregate_Emotion has a direct impact on stock prices, with the emotions emanati ng from news media having the greater influence. With respect to t h e in d i rect p ath , w e also f in d evidence to suggest that Aggregate_Emotion impacts on how investors respond to earnings news, and particularly good earnings new s. In this case, it is still the emotions emanating from the news media that has the greater influ ence but to a lesser extent tha n was the case for the direct path. Aggregate Positive Emotion an d Aggregate Negative Emotion We have established that Aggregate_Emotion has a significant influen ce on investor behaviour. However, Aggregate_Emotion is an aggregation across a whole spectrum of emotions, some of which will contribute to an investor's state of mind in a posit ive sense, and others in a negative sense. To better understand the im pact of emotions, we break em otions down into a positive and negative component (i. e., valence) to better understand how emo tions influence investors\u2019 decision making. Our findings for aggregate posit ive emotions and aggregate nega tive emotions are reported in Table 3 of Panel B and Panel C. We start by considering the dir ect impact that ag gregate positive and negative emotions have on market valuations. Our analysis o f emotive tones extracted from news and social media reveals that both aggregate positive and negative emotions bear a statistically significant influe nce on asset prices, with posit ive emotions positively linked to a surge in market valuations, while negative emotions exhibit a negativ e influence on prices. Further, the aggregate positive emotions have the greater absolute impact, w hich is consistent with our previous finding that Aggregate_Emotion has a positive impact on market valuations. Also Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346423 consistent with our findings for Aggregate_Emotion , we find that emotions, as proxied by the news media, have far more significant influen ce through the direct c hannel on investor behaviour. <<INSERT TABLE 3>> When measured across the news and social media combined, we fin d that both aggregated positive and negative emotions have the expected impact on how investors react to the release of earnings news.",

In contrast, negative emotions significantly increas e the impact of bad news and reduces the impact of good news. Our findings emphasise that no t only does the sum of all the emotions ( Aggregate_Emotion ) impact on how investors react to information, but the aggrega te of the positive and negative components, when measured across both the news and social media, does likewise. We do see some weakening in the findings when we examine the in fluence of the aggregated positive and negative emotions as proxied by either the social media or the news media, alone. For example, we found using the comb ined measure that aggregated ne gative emotions diluted the impact of a poor earnings announcement but when we examine the influence of the aggregated negative emotions score as measured from each of the news and s ocial media, we find the sign on the relationship is still negative but that it is no longer sig nificant. Overall, we find as with Aggregate_Emotion, that it is the emotions emanating from the news media that has the greater influence on investor behaviour. Individual Emotions We have found strong evidence from our examination of the aggre gate emotions score and its positive and negative sub-components that emotions have a stron g influence on investor decision- making. We will now dig deeper to examine the extent to which t he findings for the aggregated Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346424 measures are driven by each of the nine individual emotions inc luded in the study. We will first examine the four positive emot ions (optimism, joy, trust, love/ hate), and then the five negative emotions (stress, gloom, f ear, anger, and conflict). Individual Positive Emotions When we examine the combined individual positive emotions acros s both the news and social media, we find that all four of them have the expected positive direct impact on stock valuations with that of trust being the st rongest and that o f love/hate be ing the weakest13. In the case of both optimism and trust, it is the emotion emanating from the news m edia that has the greater influence whereas with joy and love/hate the news media would seem to hav e little or no influence and it is the social media that has the grater direct impact. We find strong support for the ex istence of the second channel through which emotions influence the extent to which investors react to unexpected earnings news . However, there is variation in the strength of this relationship acr oss each of the four individua l positive emotions. In the case of a positive earnings surprise, each of the four emotions determine d using a combination of the news and social media have the expect ed impact of boosting the respo nse to good news. This influence is most substantial in the case of optimism and trust and not s tatistically significant for joy and love/hate. Similarly, with negative earnings surprise, we find the expected result that each of the four positive emotions serve to dampen the extent of the invest or response to bad earnings news. In the case of optimism, joy, and love/hate, the influence of t he positive emotions is so great that it results in no negative price reaction for reporting poor ear nings news. Overall, the two media sources are of fairly equal inf luence in the case of optimism, joy, and trust. However, in the case 13 The tables on which this discus sion is based is contained in A ppendix 2. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346425 of love/joy it is the social media that has the greater influen ce which is consistent with our finding for this emotion when consid ering the direct impact. Individual Nega tive Emotions In contrast to our findings for the four positive emotions, not all the five individual negative emotions contribute to the findi ngs that we have previously obs erved at the aggregate level14.",

However, when we examine this at the level of individual negative emotions, we find that only stress, gloom, and conflict make such a contribution with stock valuati ons being seemingly unaffected b y either fear or anger. We also find that each of the social and news media make an important c ontribution to our finding that stress, gloom, and conflict each have a direct impact on stock valuations, with the news media having the stronger influence. When we turn our attention to how individual negative emotions influence investor response to unexpected earnings announcements, we find that stress, gloom, and conflict each play an important role in shaping investor response to positive earning s news by dampening the impact that good earnings news has on stock valuation. In the case of negative earnings news, it is only stress and gloom that impact on investor behaviour by causing a greater negative reaction to bad news. Importantly, we find that with fear or anger, we have two emotions which have no influence on how an investor responds to the release of unexpected earnin gs. When it comes to determining which of the two media sources has the greater influence on inv estors when it comes to responding to negative emotions, we find it the news media that has the gr eater influence in the case of conflict, 14 The information on which this discussion is based is contained in Appendix 3. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346426 it is the social media in the case of conflict, while two media sources have a similar influence in the case of gloom. Although we provide strong evidence that the aggregate of the n ine individual emotions (i.e., Aggregate_Emotion ) impact on the decision-making of investors and so corporate v aluations, it is clear that not all the five individual negative emotions contri bute to this outcome. Importantly, we find that neither anger nor fear has any discernible influence on how the decisions made by investors. Of these two emotions, the finding of the irrelevanc e o f f e a r i s p e r h a p s t h e m o r e surprising as statements are often made as to how stock prices are moved by 'greed' and 'fear' (Breaban and Noussair, 2018). Indeed, Griffith et al, using the same TRMI data found much weaker evidence for the influence of emotions with fear being t he most influential of the emotions that they examined. However, the y used a time series test, and examined only a limited number of emotions with a much smaller data set. We surmise that in our case the supposed impact of fear is captured by stress, and even gloom, which results in fear no t appearing to have a significant influence on invest or decision- making15. Impact of Emotions Over Time Our data covers 20 years, over which there have been dramatic c hanges in the media landscape, especially with the growth of social media. At our starting dat e of January 1998, social media was in its infancy, with the first recognisable social media site, Six Degrees launched in 1997, which enabled users to upload a profil e and make friends with other u sers. In 1999, the first blogging sites became popular, creating a form of social media communica tion that has conti nued with rapid growth. Hence, the first sub-sample that we have chosen extends from January 1998 to December 15 We conduct additional checks to en sure the robustness of our re ported findings, focusing on two crucial proxies used in the study: unexpected earnings and a bnormal returns. For unexpected earnings, we repeated the ana lysis using different scaling methods, such as scali ng by the median cons ensus analyst foreca st and by price and f ound that the results remained quantitativ ely similar to our main analysis. Reg arding abnormal returns, we re calculated them using the market model to capture excess return s, and once again, our major fi ndings remained unchanged.",

YouTube was founded in 2005, creating an entirely new way for p eople to communicate and share digital materials globally. It w as quickly followed in 2006 by both Facebook and Twitter. Hence, we have chosen January 2006 as being the date when social media began to be established as a wide-ranging communications channel. For our purposes, April 20 13 is another critical date. During this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that companies could now use social media to distribute material information t o market participants. With this in mind, we have split the period since January 2006 into two sub- periods: January 2006 to June 2013 and July 2013 to December 2017. We report in Table 4 a summary of the impact that Aggregate_Emotion has on investor responses to media postings during each of the sub-periods16. Our findings suggest the emotions emanating from the media as a proxy for i nvestor emotions has had a direc t influence on how investor value stocks over our entire sample period, and in each sub-period. H owever, the reported coefficients indicate that the impact of Aggregate_Emotion has considerably strengthened over the period. When we examine both the absolute level and change of Aggregate_Emotion over time, we can see that the news media continue s to have the greater influence social media but with social media's influence increas ing over time. <<INSERT TABLE 4>> We obtain quite different results when we examine the influence of both types of media over time in relation to the market's reaction to bad and good earnings n ews. Over the first seven years of our 20-year sample, Aggregate_Emotion had no influence on how investors reacted to bad earnings 16 The findings for the other emotio ns lead to simi lar conclusions as those reported here for Aggregate_Emotion . Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346428 news. In contrast, over the most recent period, Aggregate_Emotion played a very important role in dampening the impact that bad earnings news had on security prices. In contrast, Aggregate_Emotion has played an important role over the entire sample period in influencing investor response to good earning s news. Somewhat surprisingly though, the strength of this influence has marginally weakened over time. Over the whole sam ple period, it has been Aggregate_Emotion emanating from social media tha t has proved the more important i n influencing investor responses to earnings announcements, a fin ding that is stronger in the case of the reaction to good earnings news. In summary, the Aggregate_Emotion emanating from both social media and the traditional news has influenced investor behaviour over our 20-year sample perio d. On balance, the level of influence exerted by the media has increased over time and not surprisingly, the greatest growth being associated with the Aggregate_Emotion emanating from social media. 7. Conclusion In this study we use nine emotion measures extracted from a tex tual analysis of the news and social media postings as proxies for i nvestor emotions. We find that at the aggregated level, there is strong evidence to support that em otions directly impact market prices and can also influence how investors react to information si gnals. Positive emotions direc tly boost security prices and the market response to good news while dampening the response to ba d news, while negative emotions directly dampen security prices and the response to good news w hile boosting the market response to bad news. When examining the impact of the individual emotions, we find c lear evidence that some emotions have greater impact on asset pri ces than others. When we examin e the four positive emotions, for example, Optimism and joy clearl y have a powerful direct and in direct influence on asset pricing. On the other hand, trust seems to have lesser impact on prices. For example, a higher level for trust Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346429 does not influence how investors react to poor company performa nce.",

        "content": "For Love/Hate, we find that this emotion does affect how i nvestors respond through the indi rect channel, but it has a weak direct impact on s ecurity pricing. The influence of the individual negative emotions proves to be weaker and even more variable than was found to be the case for the positive emotions. Stress , Gloom, and Confli ct all directly impact security pricing, whereas the other two negative emotion s have no impact. Stress and Gloom each strongly influence how investors react to earnings n ews. In contrast, the influence is much weaker or non-existent across the other three negative emo tions. Overall, Stress and Gloom are the two negative emotions tha t impact investor behaviour mo st, with fear having little or no influence at all. We also examined the relative influence of each of the two medi a sources, including how this might have changed over time. In the early years of our sample, the proxy derived from the news media was the more influential of the two media sources, which is a dominance that it maintained over the whole sample period, al though the influence of social media has grown most in a relative sense in the intervening years. The study represents the most comp rehensive analysis of how inv estor emotions influence their decision-making. The findings pr ovide clear evidence that emoti ons play an important role in asset pricing, which has significant im plications for how assets are priced in markets and questions the extent to which markets can be assumed to be efficient. The stu dy has clearly conc entrated on the role played by emotions in influe ncing investor behaviour aroun d the time of the release of an earnings announcement. It would be informative to extend this a nalysis to the post-announcement period to determine how permanent are any mispricings caused by emotions. This would not only be invaluable in terms of the insights it provides as to the ef ficiency of markets but also as to the opportunity to use information re lating to emotions as the basi s for profitable investment strategies. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=446346430 Another line of future research would involve extending the ana lysis to examine the influence of emotions to other markets (e.g., debt markets and currency mark ets) and to its impact on particular corporate actions (e.g., mergers and takeovers, and initial pub lic offerings). Yet another line of research would be to dig deeper to examine whether different in vestor groups and/or different types of stocks were more influe nced by emotions than others.

Therefore, we apply Equation 2 to our data to investigate the separate pri ce impact of unexpected good news (PUE) and unexpected bad news (NUE). PUE are events where the announced earnings are greater than or equal to the latest median consens us analyst forecast earnings. PUE is calculated by multiplying the unexpected earning by a dummy variable which takes the value of 1 if there are positive earnings surprises a nd 0 otherwise. Similarly, the NUE event occurs when the earnin gs just announced fall short of the latest median consensus analyst forecast earnin gs. NUE is calculated by multi plying the unexpected earning by a dummy variable which takes t he value of 1 if there are negative earnings surprises and 0 otherwise. The coefficients reported in panel B of table 2 for NUE ( \ud835\udefd\u0b35=0.017***) and PUE ( \ud835\udefd\u0b36=0.034***) confirm that investor s react to both negative and positive news, with the response being greater for a quantum of good news than it is for a quantum of bad news. This finding d iffers from previous findings and perhaps reflects that unlike other studies, we confine our sample to only firms within the S&P500 index. We further divide the Unexpected Earnings into Positive Unexpec ted Earnings (PUE) and Negativ e Unexpected Earnings (NUE).

There are two implications that we take from this informa tion: (i) We can see that sentiment forms for a longer period and we see a trend in one d irection before reversing. (ii) If we look at the emotion of STRESS18 at the market level for S&P500, we see that it spikes in one direction which quickly rev erses. These findings support th e argument by (Munezero et al., 2014) that emotions are brief episodes whereas sentiment i s much more permanent.

In determining the Black Swan events, the research made use of multiple strategies against two portfolios. By utilizing the python notebooks, signals created by the Black Swan and Bollinger Bands trading strategies were compared for performance against the baseline index (buy-and-hold strategy). This was followed by a validation of how risk mitigation techniques like the stop-loss affect the trading performance. The research concluded that it is possible to construct a Mean-Reverse strategy that outperforms the market over time.

Introduction In the presence of Mean Reversion which implies the tendency of variables like stock prices to converge to an average value over time (Ronald Balvers et al. (2000)), various trading strategies have been developed to take advantage of mean reverting behaviors (Fischer and Riedler (2014)). While mean reversion has been ridiculed as being unrealistic (Lo and MacKinlay (1988), practical examples of mean reversion in prices have been found in a number of empirical studies including Gatev et al. (2006), Leung and Li (2016) as well as Avellaneda and Lee (2010). Another study found no statistically significant evidence that price movements in calendar time scale consistently deviate from randomness. There were only limited departures split between trend and mean-reversion depending on the time frame, prices and assets. [5] A Black Swan event, according to Brun\u00e5ker and Nordqvist (2013:5), is \u201cone which could not be predicted in advance by (all but a very few of) the observers\u201d. Because of Mean Reversion and Black Swan events, trading strategies need to be built that can take advantage of the two. In light of that, this research is carried out to analyze the effectiveness of Black Swan strategies for Short Term Mean Reversion systems, the risks and rewards profiles of such betting systems based on the S&P 500 index. 1.1. Problem Statement Financial time series are multifractal, thus exhibiting non-Gaussian distribution, the presence of extreme values (outliers), and long-range dependent dynamics. A constant challenge for quantitative traders is these frequent adjustments of financial markets, often abruptly, due to surges such as government policy, influences of regulatory bodies and other macroeconomic effects. Predicting such changes is a daunting process albeit undertaken by quantitative traders. As pointed out by Barber and Odean (2000), trading is indeed hazardous to your wealth. After studying 66,465 households from 1991 to 1996, individuals who traded the most underperformed the market returns significantly even without considering transaction costs. While those results advocate for buy and hold strategy, we see traders buying and selling stocks frequently because they believe they may beat the market. While it may be possible to beat the market, there's a need to appreciate the continuous change in trends of assets leading to adjustments in returns via shifts in their means, volatilities and correlation which impact the effectiveness of time series methods that rely on stationarity. These steady changes eventually lead to dynamically-varying correlation, excess kurtosis (fat tails), heteroskedasticity as well as skewed returns. The need for accurate quantitative modeling necessitates effective detection and categorization of these trends in order to optimally select quantitative trading strategies and select the best parameters within them. The modeling task then becomes an attempt to identify new trends and adjust strategy deployment, risk management and position sizing criteria accordingly. Technical analysis uses indicators designed to help a trader determine whether current behavior is indicative of a particular trend and also the timing of a potential future trend. However, a technical indicator always needs to be used within a time frame and the problem of determining the best time frame can be the solution to most quantitative 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3538891SSRN working paper modeling problems (Fernandez-Blanco et al.

        "content": "Background This work has been inspired by the thesis of Fabian Brun\u00e5ker & Andreas Nordqvist, \u201cA Performance Evaluation of Black Swan Investments\u201d. [2] Their thesis evaluated an investment strategy that was exploiting the market\u2019s reaction to unpredictable events, called Black Swans. They created a portfolio, consisting of ten of the stocks from the Stockholm Stock Exchange with the largest price change after days with extreme negative returns and the ten of the stocks with the least change in price after extreme positive returns. The authors used various factors to define the Black Swan events, among them the Jarque-Bera statistics. In their work they used the mean-reversion strategy based on the law of large numbers that states that the sample mean approaches the true mean if the number of observations is large enough. 1.3. Black, White and Grey Swan Events According to Nassim Taleb, the originator of the catchphrase \u201cBlack Swans\u201d through his book, \u201cThe Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable\u201d. A black swan event means a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: its unpredictable; its effect is massive; and, after the incident had occurred, we formulate an explanation that makes it appear less random and more predictable than it was. Recently, especially since the financial crisis, the wave of bad news in markets suggests unexpected events with a major impact are happening increasingly frequently. Grey Swan on the other hand depicts a highly probable event with three principal characteristics: its predictable; its impact can easily escalate; and, after the incident had occurred, we formulate an explanation that recognizes the probability of occurrence but shifts our focus to errors in judgment or some other human form of causation. As events earlier classified as highly improbable i.e Black Swans are increasing in frequency, most of those events earlier referred to as Black Swan are now reclassified as Grey Swan ( the risk team at PwC put out a paper in 2012 called: \u201cBlack swans turn grey\u201d [15]). This is not because these events have less severe impacts but because they have become more probable than before. Recent examples are; the US deficit, the eurozone crisis, political concerns in the Middle East, and a slowdown in China. Lastly, a white swan event is a highly certain event with three principal characteristics: its certain; it affects an impact that can easily be estimated; and, after its occurrence, we formulate an explanation that agrees with the certainty of occurrence though we tend to shift our focus to errors in judgment or some other human form of causation. Some examples of common white swan events are Healthcare, economic growth and increase in population. For our study, we chose Black Swan events to demonstrate the working of the models. However, our models can work seamlessly with white and grey swan events, few parameters only need to be changed to accommodate more events that are not absolutely outlier 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3538891SSRN working paper 1.4. Research Questions This project should answer the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: H \u200b 0: \u200b It is not possible to construct a Mean-Reverse strategy solely based on the BB indicator that outperforms the market over time. H \u200b 1: \u200b It is possible to construct a Mean-Reverse strategy solely based on the BB indicator that outperforms the market over time Hypothesis II: H \u200b 0 \u200b : It is not possible to construct a Mean-Reverse strategy based on the Black Swan events that outperforms the market over time. H \u200b 1 \u200b : It is possible to construct a Mean-Reverse strategy based on the Black Swan events that outperforms the market over time. 2. Theoretical Framework 2.1. Mean-Reversion Mean reversion trading is the theory which suggests that prices, returns, or various economic indicators tend to move to the historical average or mean over time. The research is still inconclusive about whether stock prices revert to the mean. Some studies show the mean reversion in some data sets over some periods, but many others do not. For example, in 2000, Ronald Balvers, Yangru Wu and Erik Gilliland found some evidence of mean reversion over long investment horizons. [3] 2.2.",

        "content": "Bollinger Bands The BB indicator is a basic indicator that uses the Mean-Reverse concept. John Bollinger, creator of the Bollinger Bands\u00ae defines Bollinger bands as ''a technical analysis tool, they are a type of trading band or envelope''. Bollinger bands use a statistical measure known as the standard deviation, to establish where a band of likely support or resistance levels might lie. This is a specific utilization of a broader concept known as a volatility channel. A volatility channel plots lines above and below a central measure of price. These lines, also known as envelopes or bands, widen or contract according to how volatile or nonvolatile a market is. [1] Further we are going to show that the Bollinger Bands alone cannot be considered a sign for buy or sell signals, they just show when the asset is overbought or oversold. 2.3. Black Swan events A Black Swan event is \u201cone which could not be predicted in advance by (all but a very few of) the observers\u201d, F. Brun\u00e5ker & A. Nordqvist (2013:5). It\u2019s important to note that Black Swan events are considered outliers in econometric meaning values that deviate from the rest of the data (Newbold, 2013). According to Taleb (2007a), \u201cmost life changing moments in our lives are a result of randomness and uncertainty, our inability to predict these events, even by so-called \u201cexperts\u201d, and our invariable reaction to these events (surprise)\u201d. Thus, a Black Swan also includes \u201cthe absence of an expected event\u201d. 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3538891SSRN working paper For an event to be termed a black swan, some conditions must be met: \u25cf The event must be unpredictable. \u25cf The event causes a major impact. It should be noted that event itself and its consequences may either be positive or negative for example wars, natural disasters and technical innovations. Also, black swan theory also applies to events happening to an individual and not necessarily a large number of people all the time. \u25cf The ex post explanation where there must be interests in finding explanations for the occurrence of the event after it has happened. Thus, the Black Swan events can be defined using the following techniques[2]: \u25cf \u22655% monthly decrease/increase [3], \u25cf \u22651.5% daily decrease/increase [4], \u25cf > three standard deviations from the mean, \u25cf Fails Jarque-Bera test for normality Jarque-Bera statistics The null hypothesis, that the sample is normally distributed, is rejected if the JB statistic is larger than the significance points \u200b [5] \u200b . 2.4. Black Swan Investment Strategy We invested in stocks which have had the largest percentage decrease or increase after an extreme event. Based on the mean reversion assumption, we expect these stocks to come back to their fundamental mean values thus providing us the highest profit. We can go either long or short relevant to the negative or positive Black Swan event. The Black Swan events should give much stronger signals for the trade than the regular Bollinger Bands strategy, that\u2019s why we expect to see better results here. 3. Methodology 3.1. Data We took 500 stocks from S&P500 index, choose from them a dozen stocks with the largest number of extreme events and a dozen stocks with the lowest value of the Jarque Bera test that validates the asset normality. All of them traded by the various trading strategies, among them the BB indicators. From the S&P500 assets we excluded the Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) because when it first listed on the stock exchange it has had an enormous performance and could solely influence the whole portfolio, as well as other assets that doesn\u2019t exist in Quandle before year 2010, for example Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Some assets inside the portfolio are highly correlated among themselves. We could remove them too but still left them as is for the sake of simplicity. 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3538891SSRN working paper Figure 1. Netflix Inc. Figure 2.

AAL asset with Black Swan trade signals 3.3 The Black Swans Trading Strategy We used 3 different Black Swan strategies: 1. Daily Events \u200b : The current asset price is different in N% from the K-day rolling mean 2. 3-STD Events \u200b : The current asset price lays out of the 3 standard deviations with the K-day rolling mean. 3. Outlier Events \u200b : The trading signals were selected from the IsolationForest outliers with the contamination of N. The IsolationForest is the Machine Learning algorithm implemented in the python\u2019s sklearn library. The outliers are compared against the asset\u2019s K-day mean. The IsolationForest \u2018isolates\u2019 observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. \u200b [13] When Black Swan event is located above the mean we consider it the short event, and when it is below the mean - we consider it the long event. The long/short trades are closed only when opposite trade starts without considering any other conditions, like crossing means. 3.4. The Bollinger Bands Trading Strategy In BB indicators we compared rolling mean with STDs against another quick rolling mean instead of the real asset in order to decrease the number of trades. For example, the quick rolling mean can be the 5-day and the STD can be calculated based on the 20-day rolling mean. The trading signals for the BB indicator: 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3538891SSRN working paper \u25cf When asset crosses the \u200b Upper Bollinger Band from below means that the asset is overbought and we open a short position and sell one unit of the asset. \u25cf When asset crosses the \u200b Lower Bollinger Band from above means that the asset is oversold and we open a long position and buy one unit of the asset. \u25cf When asset crosses the \u200b Bollinger Mean we close all existing positions both long and short. All trading strategies generate many identical sequential signals. In that case we take into account only the first signal and the rest identical signals remain unattended.

        "content": "3.5 Tuning Hyperparameters We used the Bayesian Optimization algorithm for choosing the best hyperparameters for our trading strategies. The optimization function goal was to reach the maximum portfolio return after the 500 iterations. We know that the professional traders tend to use other targets for the optimization functions like, for example Sharpe ratio, VaR or CVaR. We will be using here the total asset returns for the sake of simplicity. We are not using the cross-validations (separating dataset to the train/test datasets) for the sake of simplicity, so the results may be quite overfitted. We also neglect the trading costs and the costs of borrowing money for long trades and borrowing assets for short trades. We also don\u2019t rebalance the portfolio and calculate all future signals based on the whole historical data without yearly or quarterly cropping it. The idea of Bayesian Optimization by using the Hyperopt library described in the [14] \u25cf Bayesian optimization chooses the next hyperparameters in an informed way, and as such spends more time evaluating areas of the parameter distribution it believes have the highest chance of bringing a cross-validation score improvement versus previous iterations. \u25cf This can result in fewer evaluations of the objective function and better generalization performance on the test set compared to random or grid search. \u25cf The relative benefits of Bayesian Optimization differ with the number of dimensions of the dataset and the size of the parameter grid. The larger the dataset and / or the parameter grid, the higher the potential for efficacy gains. \u25cf Random Search can still outperform Bayesian Optimization as it could bump onto the optimal set of hyperparameters right at the start \u2014 just by sheer luck. The hyperparameters for each asset are calculated separately and all assets then combined together into an equally-weighted portfolio. These are the used hyperparameters limits for every trading strategy: \u25cf Bollinger Bands \u25cb stop-loss: from 0 to 0.6, step 0.05 \u25cb asset mean: from 1 to 5, step 1 \u25cb BB mean: from 10 to 900, step 5 \u25cf Daily Black Swans \u25cb stop-loss: from 0 to 0.6, step 0.05 \u25cb asset mean: from 2 to 200, step 1 10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3538891SSRN working paper \u25cb break event: from 10% to 50%, step 5% \u25cf 3-STD Black Swans \u25cb stop-loss: from 0 to 0.6, step 0.05 \u25cb asset mean: from 1 to 100, step 1 \u25cf Outliers Black Swans \u25cf stop-loss: from 0 to 0.6, step 0.05 \u25cf asset mean: from 50 to 500, step 5 \u25cf contamination: from 0.01 to 0.2, step 0.005 3.6. Evaluation methods The Hypothesis proved by comparing the BB/BS total return against the baseline index total return. In addition, we also take into account the strategies\u2019 Sharpe ratios, Calmar ratios and the Win/Loss rates. We are using the Calmar ratio because the Sharpe ratio assumes the normal distribution and therefore doesn\u2019t take into account tail risk, Black Swans etc. On the other hand, the Calmar ratio uses the maximum returns drawdown instead of the standard deviation. The maximum drawdown is the largest drop of returns, when considering sequential tops and bottoms. It is the largest peak to trough decline. [10][11] The Win/Loss rate determines whether the strategy perform consistently, or the profit only concentrate on a few trades that is very profitable [12] 4. Results 4.1. Hypothesis I It is not possible to construct a Mean-Reverse strategy solely based on the BB indicator that outperforms the market over time. The hypothesis is rejected \u200b - the BB strategy profits for \u201cBlack Swans\u201d portfolio (low normality) didn\u2019t reach the buy-and-hold values but outperformed in the \u201cJarque Bera\u201d portfolio (high normality).

        "content": "According to this strategy, the stock price should fall when a stock is overbought, but would only signal a \u2018sell\u2019 as soon as the downward trend begins. Since the bands are two standard deviations below and above the moving average, this alternatively provides a relative definition of high and low. However, because stock prices always reflect the true value of firms as per the efficient market hypothesis (Fama, 1995), no overbuying or overselling can be witnessed. As expected, in an efficient market, like the S&P 500, the BB strategy could not generate abnormal returns. As pointed out by Vargas and Estrada (2012), mean reversion must be present for the strategy to outperform the market. Their assumption was that indices do not follow random walk but are mean reverting. We assumed mean reversion for our trading strategy. Although there\u2019s inconclusive evidence about mean reversion, DeBondt and Thaler (1985) found \u201cmean reversion to occur in the second and third year of the test period, with only little mean reversion within the first 12 months\u201d. In addition, both Bali et al. 2008 and Spierdijk et al. 2012 found evidence of mean reversion absorbing half of a shock after four to eight years. Furthermore, mean reversion was proved by Gatev et al. (2006), Leung and Li (2016) as well as Avellaneda and Lee (2010). The findings from the above-mentioned researchers therefore supports our findings. If mean reversion did not exist, then our findings would have no empirical backbone which is that of mean reversion. Our findings tally with Joost de Man (2014) who looked at the STOXX Europe 600 and assessed the impact of the contrary BB strategy. His findings were that the BB strategy did not outperform the market. In addition, the BB strategy with the shortest-term moving average was found to generate the greatest abnormal returns, considering transaction costs. Furthermore, the research has found that it is possible to construct a Mean-Reverse strategy based on the Black Swan events that outperforms the market over time. Before the 2008 financial crisis, the prices of stocks were highly overbought. Because the BB strategy recognized those overbought stocks, it provided investors with a sell signal. Thus, this strategy could outperform the market in the presence of black events. As noted by Martin & Ventura (2011), most crises are preceded by speculative bubbles where asset prices are far above the intrinsic values due to investor sentiments. However, bubbles do not last forever, as they will burst one day. Thus, in the event of a Black Swan event, the strategy generated abnormal returns and outperformed the market as it generated the buy-signals during economic decline as well as the sell-signals when it bottomed and began to recover (Chuen & Gregorio, 2014). 5.1. Contributions to literature This research contributes to literature in several ways. Firstly, this study investigated mean reversion trading strategies and the black swan events through constructing portfolios on the S&P 500 as highlighted in the methodology. This trading strategy provided can be applied by the investors who prefer sensation seeking and are less than fully rational. Moreover, the Bollinger Bands strategy applied on S&P 500 contributes to the existing literature which is very limited. Apart from that, it has been proven that the BB strategy generates higher returns than the Buy and Hold strategy before transaction costs which contradicts Barber and Odean (2000) who concluded that \u201cexcessive trading by investors will underperform the B&H strategy, even before transaction costs\u201d Last but 16 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3538891SSRN working paper not least, this research can help traders to build Black swan trading strategies to exploit mean reversion in security prices as it has been proven. 6. Summary of research findings, conclusions and recommendations 6.1. Introduction This chapter outlines the summary of research findings and gives the conclusions that can be drawn from the study. In addition, it also gives recommendations to traders and paves the way for further studies in the subject. 6.2. Summary of research findings This research analysed the effectiveness of Black Swan strategies for the Short Term Mean Reversion systems, the risks and rewards profiles of such betting systems based on the S&P500 index.",

        "content": "The research concluded that it is possible to construct a Mean-Reverse strategy solely based on the BB indicator that outperforms the market over time but only for the portfolio consisting from naturally distributed assets and that one can outperform the market with a mean reverse strategy based on the black swan events. 6.3. Recommendations to traders As we clearly see Bollinger Bands indicator as an implementation of the Mean-Reverse strategy alone can be considered a sign for buy or sell signals for naturally distributed assets. For the rest of the assets, in addition to the BB signs, traders must also look for a general trend direction, that means it\u2019s unclear exactly what kind of trading position each signal means, long or short. In any case the Black Swan events give much stronger signals and can be used for opening long or short trading positions. 6.4. Recommendations for Future Study This research does endorse the existence of mean reversion on the S&P500, as it was assumed to exist. We recommend an investigation of mean reversion on the S&P500 index as well as the speed of reversion. Researchers like Lo and MacKinlay (1988), have found the evidence against mean reversion. It is also worth adding to the study of Grey and White events. They are not as strong as the Black ones but can be predicted with greater probability, opposite to the Black that cannot be predicted at all.

Soup\u00e9 Quantitative Research Group BNP Paribas Asset Management July 7, 2021 Abstract This note presents a novel, practical approach to risk management for multi-factor equity investment strategies. Our approach lies in the construction of a cross-sectional risk model using the stock return betas and a small number of style factors and macro-sectors indicator functions as explanatory variables in a cross-sectional regression. The model leads to a covariance structure that incorporates in an intuitive fashion the stocks\u2019 characteristics while at the same time possesses good conditioning properties leading to a robust optimization problems. Various portfolio constructions are analyzed in details, and some concrete examples are provided. 1 Introduction Risk modelling is an area that lies at the very core of the \ufb01nancial indus- try. In a broad sense, it pertains to the understanding, statistical analysis and mathematical modelling of the dependencies between tradeable as- sets. For instance, the modelling of variance-covariance matrices, of tail risks, of credit risk, the design of stochastic volatility and correlation mod- els... are intrinsically part of risk modelling. This article addresses the risk management of multi-factor investment strategies. Much as any in- vestment strategy, a multi-factor investment portfolio is built using a risk model that is fully determined, in the usual quadratic framework, by a covariance structure between stock returns. There is however a host of di\ufb00erent ways to de\ufb01ne such a covariance structure: one can rely on em- pirical models, time series based-factor models, cross-sectional models... Our aim in this paper is to design a risk model that is speci\ufb01c to the context of factor investing , by providing a simple, inutitive and robust covariance structure that faithfully re\ufb02ects the stock characteristics. Let us \ufb01rst brie\ufb02y recall what we mean by \"factors\". \u0003frederic.abergel@bnpparibas.com 1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3878183Factors are characteristics of assets that are important to explain their risk and performance. For instance, in the stock market, the Capital As- set Pricing Model (CAPM) model asserts that the performance of a stock should be determined by a single stock characteristic, the beta. However, it is now widely accepted, and vastly documented in the academic litera- ture, see e.g. the seminal papers [5] and [10], that other factors known as Value, Low Volatility, Quality and Momentum play a role in explaining stock returns. Valuecharacteristicssuchastheprice-to-bookortheprice-to-earnings of a company measure the relative cheapness of a stock. It has been found that on average, over time, cheaper stocks tend to out-perform other stocks, in particular expensive stocks. Volatility is a measure of a stock price \ufb02uctuations over time. Evidence that less volatile stocks generate at least comparable returns to riskier stocks renders stocks with lower volatility more attractive for investors: same returns in the medium to long-term with less uncertainty. It is also known that higher quality stocks, e.g. themostpro\ufb01tablecompanies, tendtogeneratehigherreturns than other stocks, in particular when compared to the least pro\ufb01table companies. Di\ufb00erent measures of pro\ufb01tability can be used, e.g. return- on-equity. Last, stocks with the strongest price trends, e.g. stocks with the strongest out-performance relative to other stocks as measured over theprevious12monthsalsotendtocontinuetooutperform. Thisisknown as the momentum e\ufb00ect. The building blocks of factor investing are the single factor portfo- liosbuilt from suitable ranking, aggregation, normalization and neutral- ization. Thesearelong-shortportfolioswithweightsthatre\ufb02ectsthescore of an asset according to one particular member of the factor family. From there on, multi-factor investing consists in building, based on these single factor portfolios, a multi-factor, investable portfolio. This rather involved industrial process can be decomposed into two major steps. The \ufb01rst one requires generating a global score for each stock, leading to a theoretical long-short portfolio. The second, more technical step amounts to building an investment portfolio meeting a set of requirements such as weight positivity, diversi\ufb01cation, low turnover or controlled volatility. Let us now turn towards the main topic of this paper, namely, the design of a risk model . A risk model consists in the design of the dependency structure be- tween assets and the analysis of its evolution over time.",

        "content": "It is an essential tool for the construction of an investment portfolio, which in its simplest form due to Markowicz relies on two components: a set of expected re- turns and a covariance matrix. In principle, one could design separately these two components of the optimization program. It is however useful and important, as analyzed and explained in for instance [13], that the risk model, as a portfolio construction tool, be consistent with the view one has on the market, that is, with the set of expected returns. The focus throughout this paper is on portfolio construction for multi-factorial in- vestment strategies. Since such strategies typically use the factor scores as the building blocks of their expected returns, we will therefore concentrate on factor-based risk models. Speci\ufb01cally, we shall adopt a cross-sectional view to explain the stock return \"alphas\" - the excess returns over the 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3878183CAPM returns - by the characteristic portfolio weights and some addi- tional, industrial sector-based variables.

By nature, the risk model and portfolio construction analyzed in this paper are essentially model for the alpha of stocks and portfolios, a fact that is already re\ufb02ected in the very con- struction of the characteristic portfolios as long-short, low beta portfolios. Eventually, we will design a long-only, investment portfolio with a beta equal to 1, and hope that its excess returns over the benchmark yield some good performances. As a consequence, it is natural to deal separately with the beta and alpha part of the model, as we now explain. Consider then the simple CAPM representation Ri(t) = iRM(t) + i: (1) The plan is the following: \ufb01rst, the market beta of the stocks is computed based on time-series regression; then, a cross-sectional regression is used to explain the stock return alphas. This dual approach is rather classical and has been widely advertised and studied, see e.g. [11][8][4] 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3878183for general mixed models of this type. However, let us point out right away that the speci\ufb01c model we have in mind is both parsimonious and adapted to multi-factor investing, so that the risk factors will pretty much be the same factors as those used to model the stock expected returns. This point will be developped at greater length in Section 5. 3.1 The stock betas The \ufb01rst task at hand is of course to identify the stock betas. Broadly speaking, for each asset in the investment universe, the time series of its returns are linearly regressed against that of the market returns. There are several speci\ufb01c choices to be made, pertaining to the time horizon, weighing method, reference index... and we do not go into such details here. Su\ufb03ce it to say that, from now on, the vector of stock betas is assumed to be available at any time viaa systematic regression method. 3.2 Factor- and sector-based cross-sectional model Once the betas are determined, the assets\u2019 alphas1are explained viaa cross-sectional regression of the returns against some explanatory vari- ables that have a direct interpretation as elementary portfolio weights.",

        "content": "Such portfolios are of two types: long-short portfolios corresponding to the style factors Low volatility, Momentum, Quality and Value, and pure indicator portfolios corresponding to macro-sectors. Note that there are many additional evolutions that could be made: one can add \"fuzziness\" to the macro-sector de\ufb01nition, allowing portfolio weights to sit between 0 and1instead of being equal to 0or1. One can also incorporate other fac- tors, for instance a Size factor, or enrich the sector portfolios with country or region indicators. The methodology we present here is quite general, and we have simply restricted the analysis to some speci\ufb01c factors so as to provide concrete examples. In a continuous-time framework, a general factor model for the stock return alphas with sectors and style factors can be written as follows: dXi(t)\u0011dSi(t) Si(t)\u0000 i(t)dM(t) =KX k=1zki(t)d\u0015k(t) +K+SX k=K+1zki(t)d\u0015k(t) +d\u000fi(t) or, using vector notations: dX(t) =KX k=1zk(t)d\u0015k(t) +K+SX k=K+1zk(t)d\u0015k(t) +d\u000f(t):(2) The stochastic processes \u0015k(t)involved in Equation (2) represent the (model-based) excess returns over the benchmark of the characteristic (k= 1;:::;K) and sector indicator ( k=K+ 1;:::;K +S) portfolios, see the notations in Section 2. 1\u2018alpha \u2019will always refer to the CAPM alpha introduced in Equation (1) 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3878183In practice, we consider a discrete-time version of (2) for monthly returns X =K+SX k=1zk\u0015k+\u000f (3) where theK\ufb01rst vectors zkand factor returns \u0015kcorrespond to the style factors, and the Slast, to macro-sectors. The model-implied approximate returns \u0015ksimply obtain as the linear regression solution to the approximate equation fX =K+SX k=1zk\u0015k: (4) Once Equation (4) is solved, one can then undertake the task of an- alyzing the covariance structure it implies for the vector of stock return alphas X. Note that in the rest of the paper, the term \"covariance ma- trix\", \"covariance structure\", \"risk model\"... will always implicitly refer to the corresponding object obtained from stock return alphas. Remark In the examples we analyze, the style factor portfolios have been market- and sector-neutralized: 8(p;k)2f1;:::;Kg\u0002fK+ 1;:::;K +Sg;zp:zk= 0 8p2f1;:::;Kg;zp: = 0; and similar equalities obviously hold between the sector portfolios them- selves. As a consequence, the OLS solution to Equation (4) can be decom- posedintotwoindependentfactorandsectorregressions. Betweenfactors, we do not enforce any additional orthogonality conditions, as we prefer to retain as much as possible the \ufb01nancial interpretation of each style factor. For a more detailed analysis of the cross-sectional dependency structure between the factor portfolios, we refer the interested reader to [1]. 3.3 The cross-sectional factor returns and port- folios The cross-sectional approach paves the way to a new understanding of the single factor portfolios, as we now explain. Consider again Equation (4) and introduce the Gram matrix Gof the factor portfolios with entries Gpq\u0011zp:zq16p;q6K: Then, see the remark in Section 3.2 above, the solution to the factor part of the OLS regression in (3) is simply \u0003=G\u00001RLS (5) where RLSis the vector of realized returns of the original single factor portfolios : RLS k\u0011zk:R. 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3878183The solution \u0015kto Equation (5) are quite naturally termed the cross- sectional returns of the factor portfolios, and they also o\ufb00er another intuitive interpretation: they can be viewed as the realized returns of modi\ufb01ed factor portfolios yk=zkt(G\u00001)\u0011zkG\u00001(Gis symmetric). We call these new portfolios ykthecross-sectional factor portfolios . As we shall see in see Section 6.1 where their performances are analyzed, these cross-sectional factor portfolios have returns that are only weakly correlated over time - in any case, much less so than those of the original factor portfolios. This weak correlation property plays an important role in the good behaviour of the risk model and its covariance matrix. 4 Variance-covariance structure of the cross- sectional risk model In a Gaussian framework where only quadratic risk is taken into account, the key feature of a risk model is the structure of its covariance matrix, and we now proceed to build it. 4.1 Building the alpha covariance matrix Starting from the model speci\ufb01ed in Equation (3), we posit that the co- variance matrix should have two components: \ufb01rst, a term stemming form the \"explained\" part of the cross-sectional regression, based on the variance-covariance matrix of the cross-sectional returns in Equation (4).",

It is quite likely that this model fails to faithfully represent the real asset dynamics: the underlying assumption that the time series of er- ror terms have no autocorrelation and be uncorrelated with the factor and sector returns is far from being guaranteed by the cross-sectional or- thogonality property. We will however show that, simple as it is from an econometric point of view, see Section 4.2 below, this model is quite valuable when used as a risk model for portfolio construction. 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3878183A remark In practice, the empirical behaviour of the cross-sectional return covariance matrix with entries Cov(\u0015k;\u0015p)suggests to make the convenient choice of a pure diagonal factor-only covariance matrix by setting the factor-factor correlations to 0. 4.2 The risk model from an econometric perspec- tive This short section is devoted to the assessment of the risk model from an econometric perspective. Quite generally speaking, this analysis is related to the rather deep question of understanding whether factors should be interpreted as trendorriskfactors. From a mathematical and statistical point of view, this question amounts to determining whether the factor and sector returns \u0015;\u0016, when viewed as stochastic processes, have zero or \ufb01nite quadratic covariations. There exists a host of theoretical results in the statistical theory of stochastic processes providing tools to answer this question2, but a practical answer is hard to get in the situations we consider, because the cross-sectional factor portfolio returns can only be sampled at very low frequency. Note that, to the contrary, the sector cross-sectional returns can be computed at a frequency as high as daily, making the analysis much more reliable. Without dwelling too much on this theoretical di\ufb03culty, we can how- ever present some results that shed a light on the econometric properties of Model (2), and the very important role played by the sector indicatri- ces. A rather straightforward numerical experiment has been performed, the idea being to generate Monte Carlo paths according to the dynamics of Model (2). It proceeds as follows: \u000fcross-sectional distributional assumptions are made on the factor portfolio weights, and they are calibrated onto the data; \u000fthe cross-sectional factor and sector portfolio returns are simulated as a low-dimensional stochastic process with drift vector and covari- ation matrix calibrated onto the data; \u000fidiosyncratic risks are simulated as an N-dimensional, uncorrelated Wiener process. Once the model inputs are calibrated onto the data, the model-implied correlationstructureiscomputedfromsimulatedpaths3. The\ufb01rstnatural question one may ask is then: does the covariance structure of the factor- and sector-based model resemble the empirical one ? Figure 1 shows the empirical joint distribution of realized and model-implied correlation for stocks in the S&P500universe, bringing a partially negative answer to that question. One can clearly see that the explanatory power of the model is rather limited and that it is necessary to incorporate the sector indicatrices in order to generate a correlation distribution possessing at least qualitatively, some of the features of the empirical distribution. 2the underlying idea behind those tools is the a.s. convergence of quadratic sums towards the integrated quadratic variation for a process with continuous sample paths, and the scaling properties of such sums as the frequency goes to 0 3It could actually be computed analytically, but we found it simpler and more \ufb02exible to 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3878183Figure 1: Model-based vsrealized correlation without (left) or with (right) sectors What is clear from this simple numerical exercise is that the assump- tionofzerocorrelationbetweentheidiosyncraticrisksisnotrealistic. This rather poor approximation of the empirical correlation between stocks prevents us from using Model (2) as a risk predictor, or even a risk man- agement tool for general portfolios.",

Although we shall eventually be using the cross-sectional risk model (4), some of the results we present here are rather general, and not at all speci\ufb01c to the cross-sectional risk model. We nonetheless think it worthwhile to revisit the portfolio construction process in details. 5.1 Building a multi-factor, theoretical long-short portfolio Based on the four style factors Low volatility, Momentum, Quality and Value, there are of course in\ufb01nitely many possibilities to build a theo- retical, multi-factorial long-short portfolio. A natural and, by now, well- documented approach is the risk budgeting approach as analysed in [3], see also e.g. [7] for a more recent analysis of risk budgeting approaches. This risk-budgeting can be based on the original, single factor portfo- lios considered as elmementary tradeable assets. However, in the speci\ufb01c context under scrutiny here, the low correlation of the cross-sectional re- turns4suggest that we rather use the new cross-sectional factor portfolios introduced in Section 3.3. For the sake of the argument, consider the equal risk budget (ERB) or contribution (ERC) portfolios, see e.g. [12], based on either the original or the cross-sectional long-short portfolio: one thus obtains four natural candidate multi-factor portfolios. When using the cross-sectional single use Monte Carlo paths 4see Section 6.1 for details 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3878183factor portfolios, both approaches yield almost identical results, thanks to the low factor-factor correlation. As opposed to this case, ERB or ERC constructions based on the original single factor portfolio lead to quite di\ufb00erent portfolios. Interestingly enough, the results in Section 6.3 show very little di\ufb00erences, in terms of performances, between the four candidate portfolios. Therefore, it makes good sense to use the simpler ERB approach based on the cross-sectional portfolios, and this will be the focus for the rest of this paper. We will now denote by Athe multi-factor portfolio weights: A=PK i=1akzkfor a set of time-varying weights ak; k= 1;:::;Kobtained via equal risk budgeting of the cross-sectional factor portfolios. 5.2 Building a long-only, investable portfolio Setting aside for the sake of clarity the turnover and transaction cost constraints, we focus on the rather general case where the optimal port- folioWand its active weight vector Qcan be written as the solution to a Markowitz portfolio optimization with the alpha variance-covariance matrix Mand a set of expected returns \u0016: sup q:\u0016 (7) q=w\u0000I 06wi qi6qmax q:e= 0 Mq:q6TE2: In Problem (7), the objective function is naturally expressed in terms of the active weight q, as are most of the constraints. In fact, only the nonnegativity constraint involves the original weight vector w. There are obviously many di\ufb00erent ways to introduce a set of expected returns derived from the factor portfolios. Here, the focus is on a special case - and one that is very important in practice - where the expected returns\u0016come from an explicit transformation of the theoretical long- short portfolio. Reverse optimization and portfolio construction The port- folio construction generating the investment strategies presented in this article rests on the useful and intuitive concept of reverse optimization as introduced by [9], see e.g. [2] for an in-depth analysis. When specialized to the case of multi-factor investing, the key underlying assumption is that the theoretical, multi-factorial long-short portfolio is, up to a mul- tiplicative constant, the active weight vector solution to the Markowitz optimization probleme with the sole risk constraint: sup q:\u0016 (8) Mq:q6TE2; 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3878183the solution of which is A=CM\u00001\u0016 for some TE-related constant C. This process is termed the reverse optimization because it builds a set of expected returns from a candidate portfolio rather than the usual other way around.",

Speci\ufb01cally, we analyse a multi- factor investment strategy in the S & P 500 universe. As already men- tioned, the four style factors we consider are Low volatility, Momentum, Quality and Value. The model uses \ufb01ve macro-sector indicator portfolios, so that there are a total number of nine variables in the cross-sectional regression of the stock return alphas. 6.1 The cross-sectional returns We study here the cross-sectional returns of the single factor portfolios. As already mentionned in Section 3.3, they are quite naturally interpreted as the realized returns of modi\ufb01ed portfolios. Comparing the cross-sectional and realized factor returns Figure 2 clearly shows that for each factor, both pro\ufb01les look quite similar -thecorrelationsbetweentherealizedandcross-sectionalportfolioreturns are all above 80%. Now, there are some di\ufb00erences, as discussed in detail in [1]. These di\ufb00erences come from the cross-sectional correlation of the single factor portfolios, that is, the fact that the Gram matrix Gintro- duced in Section 3.3 is not diagonal. This is the only feature preventing the identi\ufb01cation, up to normalization, of the realized and cross-sectional portfolio returns. Factor returns correlation A more subtle di\ufb00erence, but one with major implications, lies in the decorrelation between the factor cross- 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3878183Figure 2: Realized and cross-sectional returns sectional returns already evoked in Section 3.3. In fact, the best correla- tion model should rest on factor returns that would be as little correlated as possible, so that the correlation structure between stocks can be fully explained by the scores, see Formula (6). The global correlation matrix shown in Figure 3 indicates that style factor are \"reasonably\" decorrelated5, and the correlations are forced ac- cordingly to 0in the model. However, the sector-sector correlations may be high, as are some factor-sector correlations. In the risk model, it seems necessarytokeepthesesector-sectorandfactor-sectorcorrelationstotheir historical level in order to generate a realistic covariance matrix. This is consistent with the observations made in Section 4.2 about the relevance of sectors to explain the correlation between stocks. A time-varying analysis of these correlations, comparing them with the realized long-short portfolio returns correlations, is another argument in favour of the cross-sectional risk model: Figure 4 clearly shows that the absolute correlation level between cross-sectional factor returns is generally lower than that between the corresponding long-short portfolio realized returns.",

Spectrum of the covariance matrix The properties of matrix Min Equation (6), especially those of its spectrum, are very important. Thanks to its rather parsimonious construction and the importance of its diagonal (idiosyncratic) part, one can expect some good condition- ing properties. The results in this section show that the matrix actually behaves in a very satisfactory way. In particular, the lower end of its spectrum is 10 to 100 times higher that that of the empirical variance- covariance matrix, a fact that greatly reduces the usual small eigenvalue problems that occur in portfolio optimization. Figure 5 shows the ratio between eigenvalues of same rank in the em- pirical and model-based covariance matrices. It clearly demonstrates that theconditionnumberofthecross-sectionalmodel-basedcovariancematrix is much better than that of the empirical covariance matrix.

As explained in Section 6, they are obtained viaequal risk budgets or contributions from the original or the cross- sectional long-short portfolios. Their cumulative performances are shown on Figure 6. Clearly, the four portfolio performances are extremely similar, and the apparently better performance of the \"LS ERB\" portfolio - equal risk budgeting on the original single factor portfolios - is only due to its higher ex postvolatility. Allfourmulti-factorportfoliosactuallyhaveverysimilar information ratios all approximately equal to 1. Therefore, one needs to use other criteria to discriminate between the four candidates. 6.4 The long-only investment portfolio In this \ufb01nal section, we provide some examples of long-only investment portfolios built using the cross-sectional, factor-based risk model to solve Problem (9). The graphs show the cumulative performances of the long- only and other related portfolios: the theoretical long-short portfolio and the two additional portfolios introduced in Section 5.2.1. One of our goals here is to exemplify the role played by the tracking error (TE) constraint: for a TE set to a 5%annual volatility level, one ob- tains the investment portfolio shown on Figure 7, which is very similar to the\u0016+portfolio introduced in Equation (10). In fact, a direct inspection of the optimal portfolio active weights shows that the maximum weight constraint is very often saturated, leading to a correlation between the long-only portfolio and the \u0016+portfolio of 88%. 14 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3878183Figure 5: Comparing the empirical and cross-sectional covariance spectra Figure 6: The cumulative performances of the multi-factor long-short portfolio candidates 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3878183Figure 7: Investment portfolio with high tracking error On the other hand, setting the tracking error at the more reasonable level of 3:5%yields the more mixed results shown on Figure 8.

Campbell Harvey: When I was an undergraduate, I was not thinking that I would be an academic. I did a liberal arts degree that included mathematics, history, English, and subjects like that. During my MBA studies, I started working as a research assistant on a few academic papers, and I realized I could actu - ally contribute at the level at which I was working. A significant event happened to me in the summer of my first year. I took a job in corporate strategy at the then -largest copper - mining firm in the world, based in Toronto. I was tasked with building a model to predict future gross domestic product (GDP) growth\u2014and for copper that is very important information. Because copper moves with the business cycle, any ability to forecast GDP helped the company make decisions about opening and closing mines around the world. I knew a lot of companies did this type of forecasting with complex economet - ric models. I considered those models unnecessarily complex and extremely rigid\u2014so I had the idea of trying to extract infor - mation from financial markets. I recalled some research at the University of Chicago had analyzed stock prices for information about future economic growth, and the evidence was mixed. At the time, the joke was that the stock market forecasted nine of the past four recessions. I started by trying to discern why this information was so unre - liable. The stock market seemed like an ideal indicator because we would expect future economic growth to drive anticipated cash flows for companies. But in the case of equities, a lot of other things are going on. As a result, there are many false signals. So I looked at the bond market. Bond yields are also forward -looking , but there are a number of differences between, let\u2019s say, Treasury bonds and the stock market. First, bonds have a fixed maturity, stocks do not. Second, Treasury bonds have a fixed coupon, which means investors know exactly how much they will get at the bond\u2019s maturity, so essentially the cash flows are fixed. Campbell R. Harvey is a professor of finance at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, and a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He is a Fellow of the American Finance Association, which he served as president in 2016. Harvey served as a visiting scholar at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. He earned a PhD in business finance from the University of Chicago.

HARVEy, PHD VOLUME 21 NUMBER 1 2022 5 JOURNAL OF INVESTMENT CONSULTINGhere was a forecast that was as good as one that cost thousands of dollars. After you publish a research finding, two things usually happen. First, if your finding was due to luck, the effect gets weaker. I was showing four accurate forecasts out of four, and the effect could weaken. What often happens is the effect completely fades away. The out-of-sample validation of my dissertation turned out well. We have had four recessions since I graduated, and each was preceded by an inverted yield curve. So far, no false signals. You could argue that the last forecast was lucky because the inverted yield curve in June 2019 obviously was not predicting the COVID -19 pandemic. But consider the counterfactual analysis. In late 2019, according to the Duke CFO Survey,4 70 percent of chief financial officers (CFOs) thought a recession was going to occur in the next twelve months. That is how I got started with my idea that some degree of predictability is inherent in the business cycle and also in risk premiums. I have published a number of papers on dynamic risk premiums. Each of the papers stems from my initial insight of analyzing the term structure of interest rates and economic growth in the business cycle. Inna Okounkova: So the low interest rates did not have any impact on that signal? Campbell Harvey: My model is pretty simple. It has one vari - able: the difference between long -term and short -term interest rates. It has successfully predicted eight out of the past eight recessions. The model is also good at predicting the duration of the recessions. Although some may say the model is not work - ing because of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing (QE) policy and low interest rates, my response is no model is perfect, there is a lot of noise. Indeed, the Fed\u2019s influence was far greater in the early part of my sample. In the 1960s and 1970s, Fed policy could affect the entire yield curve. Today, it is difficult for the Fed to control the yield curve because persistent government deficits and off\u2013 balance -sheet items have caused the bond market to grow very large. The Fed does have some control at the very short end, though some think that degree of control is overstated. I do not buy the argument that because of QE, my model no longer works. I have heard that argument multiple times. I heard it before the Global Financial Crisis when the yield curve inverted. I certainly heard it in 2019. Actually, I believe the Fed induces a lot of the noise, but the track record of the indicator speaks for itself. Ludwig Chincarini: When these models are used, the signal starts maybe in month T minus 10. If you actually start trading when the signal arrives, you lose money overall. Is that the case for your model, or do you always make money? Another aspect of this project that intrigued me was the risk. Stocks are risky. That shifting risk may or may not be related to the business cycle, whereas Treasury bonds are relatively risk free. Both investment vehicles should contain information about the future. Basic theory tells us that a bond\u2019s yield is a combination of the expected real rate, expected inflation, and a risk premium. The real rate is linked by economic theory to real GDP growth. I looked at the slope of the term structure of inter - est rates, or the yield curve, and I found it to be a reliable fore - caster of economic growth.",

I was out of a job as a summer student. Nevertheless, I continued working on the idea. In the fall, when I went back for the second year of my MBA program, I showed the paper to a few faculty members and they said: \u201cOh, this is important. This is a big idea.\u201d They said there are three courses you are required to take to get your degree. We will combine those into one course, and all you are going to do is work on this paper. When they looked at the next version, they suggested that I apply to a PhD program. My application said: \u201cI have an idea, and here is a draft of the paper I am work - ing on. I know it is early, but I am really interested in this research, and please admit me to your program.\u201d I was admit - ted to multiple programs, but I decided to go to the University of Chicago. I showed up with the paper, although the usual approach is to spend a couple of years doing course work and then begin thinking about your dissertation topic. For me, it was completely different. The first day at the University of Chicago, I was working on my idea. Eventually, my dissertation committee looked at the paper. They were skeptical, as they should have been. The committee included future Nobel laureates: Eugene Fama,1 who was my chair; Merton Miller;2 and Lars Hansen;3 and of course others that I learned a lot from. They were skeptical because my dissertation showed that an inverted yield curve\u2014when long -term rates go below short -term rates\u2014predicted recessions. Data were lim - ited, so the inverted yield curve worked four times out of four. The committee members said I might just be lucky. I said maybe it is a lucky finding, but the economic foundation is rock solid; my finding is not data mining. We can all agree the eco - nomic foundation should work, and it actually does work. They were impressed that I predicted the double -dip recession in the early 1980s when the major econometric services did not. Of course, they also were impressed that the cost of delivering this forecast was much lower than paying thousands of dollars for a forecast from one of the econometric services. At the time, the cost of a copy of the Wall Street Journal was 25 cents. And \u00a9 2022 Investments & Wealth Institute. Reprinted with permission.

HARVEy, PHD VOLUME 21 NUMBER 1 2022 6 JOURNAL OF INVESTMENT CONSULTINGIn the address, I point out that more than 400 factors (an implausible number) have been published in top journals, likely a result of data mining. One of the topics I discuss in the address is incentives. Journal editors want their journal to publish papers that will get as many citations as possible. They know that research with nega - tive results\u2014the researcher tests a signal that does not work\u2014 garners very few citations. Authors also know the objective function of the editor so they do not pursue papers that show negative results. They may put them in a file drawer and con - tinue try to find a factor, signal, or methodology that actually works. This practice leads to data mining and publication bias. My guess is that at more than 9 0 percent of the finance schools in the world, the author of a single publication in the Journal of Finance has a job for life. The incentive to find a factor that works is extreme. In Harvey et al. (2016), I called out the pro - fession, arguing it is likely that more than half of our empirical findings are false, which is pretty strong language. I said that goes for my research as well.",

        "content": "I think members of the profession have thought about this and have come to believe we need a higher hurdle than the usual two standard errors, or two-sigma rule, which is appropriate only if the researcher does a single test. That is basic statistics. If 400+ factors can clear this hurdle, we need a higher hurdle. Another part of my Presidential Address concerns the need to be careful about how we make inference; we need to incor- porate our prior beliefs. I give an example of a series of three experiments. The first experiment involves a musicologist who claims she can determine by looking at any two pages of a Haydn or Mozart score whether the composer is Haydn or Mozart. I play piano. I play Haydn and Mozart, but there is no way I can do that. So an experiment is designed in which ten differ - ent pairs of scores are used, and the musicologist gets ten out of ten correct. The second experiment involves a tea drinker who claims to be able to tell if the milk was put into the teacup before or after the tea was poured. This seems a little implausible. So the experi - ment uses ten pairs of cups, and the tea drinker gets ten out of ten correct. The final experiment involves a bar patron who has had too much to drink and claims that the more he drinks, the better he can see the future. In this experiment, we flip a coin ten times, and the tipsy patron calls every single one right. So, we have three different experiments\u2014ten in a row\u2014and the p-value is less than 0.001. What\u2019s your inference? What do you take away from that? Classical statistics tells us that all of Campbell Harvey: You are asking a completely different question. You are asking about using the signal in a trading strategy. I am talking about the ability of the slope of the yield curve to predict economic growth. Those are related but differ - ent questions. Given that my model has a good track record as an indicator of expected economic growth, we should be able to design some sort of strategy to trade on that signal. It is a challenge, how - ever, because the stock market does not behave exactly like the business cycle. In some recessions, the stock market actually goes up. Timing is important, so you are correct in positing that an inversion might happen a year before the recession starts. So would you wait to initiate the strategy? I have not published a paper link - ing this idea to any trading strategy, but I know some asset managers use this information for their quantitative trading strategies. Investors need to be careful in trading on this signal because we have only had eight recessions. That means only eight observations, so it is easy to overfit a strategy. In addi - tion, this information is just a single variable. An asset man - ager certainly should consider other variables in developing a successful trading strategy. Inna Okounkova: What do you regard as your major achievements? Campbell Harvey: One of my favorite papers is my 2000 Journal of Finance article on conditional skewness and pricing (Harvey and Siddique 2000), which has had a significant impact on the profession. Essentially, the concept of the paper is that we seem to be stuck in a world of expected returns and vari - ances. Even today, investors tend to compare the Sharpe ratios of different strategies and ignore other dimensions of risk. In Markowitz\u2019s 1952 Nobel prize -winning paper, he acknowl - edges the assumptions he is making. One of the assumptions he clearly spells out is that the model does not work if there is a preference for higher -order moments\u2014for example, a skew. We know that investors dislike downside risk, and we also know that asset returns are not distributed symmetrically. So it is important for asset managers to explicitly integrate the down - side risk or skew in portfolio design.",

One way to accomplish that is to explicitly take into account the downside in the optimization.

They are looking for papers that will have a major impact. A paper that is a data -mining expedition is not going to have any impact, because it is not going to perform well out of sample. In real time, however, an editor cannot discern the potential impact easily. The data -mining problem is less severe in the practice of asset management. The reason is simple: When a researcher who data mines moves the strategy into live trading, the strategy likely is going to fail. That means that the company loses repu - tation, loses the assets under management, and does not earn a performance fee. For asset managers doing quantitative research, incentives are aligned. Having the right research culture is crucial. The penalty is severe for having a culture that encourages data mining. Academia has no penalties like that, other than in the top schools, so there is no easy fix. Philip Fazio: Can\u2019t you just require an out-of-the-sample period as part of the test framework? Campbell Harvey: That is hard to do. Consider submitting a paper to the Journal of Finance , and the editor\u2019s decision letter says: \u201cThis looks interesting. Resubmit the paper with the out-of-sample evidence in twenty years.\u201d We know that stock returns are quite volatile, and the signal -to-noise ratio is really low. Twenty years might not even be enough. Again, researchers need to consider prior beliefs in the context of their being based on economic fundamentals. We simply do not have enough signal. The researcher has to be disciplined by economic theory. That is a way to minimize the effects of data mining. Ludwig Chincarini: Another thing you mentioned in your Presidential Address, which I thought was important, is that we don\u2019t do a lot of replication studies in finance or economics. How do you think the profession can move forward in this area? Would it be a good idea to have graduate students replicate someone else\u2019s work? Campbell Harvey: My 2019 paper called \u201cReplication in Financial Economics,\u201d which was published in Critical Finance Review , shows that I am an advocate of replication studies, and the mechanism you suggest is exactly what this paper proposes. The idea is that replicating a paper should be part of PhD programs for a first-year or second -year summer project. Replication has many dimensions. One goal would be just to get the result in the sample that was used, but there could be other avenues. The student could start with that, then maybe take the result out of sample to test its viability, maybe take it to a different country. Many possibilities exist, but the replication task would be assigned to a student and then\u2014 this is important\u2014the results would be posted to a public database.these results are highly significant. Experiment one involves a musicologist, and a person in that profession should be able to tell the difference between Haydn and Mozart. Perhaps you are skeptical about the tea drinker in experiment two, but maybe there is a bit of truth in the claim, and we can learn from the p-value that this person actually can discern the difference between the milk going in before or after the tea. The third experiment is preposterous. I don\u2019t care if the per - son gets twenty in a row. It does not make sense that the person can foresee the future.",

        "content": "We all need to consider our prior beliefs. Classical statistics just looks at the p-value , and too often we rely only on classical statistics. To make things worse, there are many fundamental misunderstandings about what that p-value actually means. My Presidential Address encourages members of our profession to include their prior beliefs in making inferences. This approach is not exclusive to an academic setting; it can be used in most practical asset - management decisions. Let\u2019s say you develop a trading strat - egy based on a solid economic foundation\u2014for example, my yield curve model. It appears to work. Then you are presented with a purely data -mined strategy, developed perhaps after thousands of different variables were tried. The strategy works better than the strategy with the solid economic foun\u2013 dation. So what do you do? You should severely down -weight the inference for the data -mined strategy\u2014because it is data mined\u2014and lean more toward the strategy that has a solid economic foundation. That is how prior beliefs should be used. Philip Fazio: Now that you\u2019ve exposed all of this in several good papers, where are we in the academic world with data mining? Campbell Harvey: I spent a year reading articles outside the field of finance, and only about 1 0 percent of the references in my Presidential Address are related to finance and economics. I learned how other fields minimize the chance of false posi - tives, but some of the solutions are difficult to apply to finance. For example, in an experiment in biology or the medical field, the researcher can pre-register the protocol: what will be tested, the sample size, the statistical procedure, the cutoff, the outlier exclusion rule. All parameters are specified in advance. During the experiment, the researcher follows the protocol, which minimizes the chance of severe data mining. However, in finance, the data are easily available\u2014data on stock returns, data on company fundamentals\u2014so the researcher could data mine and register the experiment, even though the researcher already knows the results. Much of the problem results from what we reward in the finance profession; for exam - ple, some schools just count a faculty member\u2019s publications and base promotions and raises on that number. Top schools, however, do not do that. They look at the quality of the papers, \u00a9 2022 Investments & Wealth Institute. Reprinted with permission.

HARVEy, PHD VOLUME 21 NUMBER 1 2022 8 JOURNAL OF INVESTMENT CONSULTINGforty -eight other signals that they know do not work. A similar problem exists in other sciences. There is no easy fix. Edward Baker: I can\u2019t help thinking that this excessive fascina - tion with factors is making the markets less efficient. Campbell Harvey: Numerous forces make the markets less effi - cient. Quantitative asset managers are typically careful about the robustness of the factors in their strategies, because they do not want to disappoint clients. Some exchange -traded funds, however, are thrown together on the basis of an academic paper. The manager pitches the fund to clients and explains that the strategy is based on peer -reviewed research. Some managers will promote hundreds of these types of funds, know - ing that more than half the strategies are probably not going to perform well, but collect the fees anyway. So, you are correct that the current focus on factors can lead to inefficiencies. Many different forces drive the balance between inefficiency and efficiency. While we have great data and the latest machine learning tools, there is still endemic overfitting. So, in deploy - ing these strategies, they drive prices away from fundamentals. We saw that happen this year with the rise of retail investors\u2019 participation growing from about 1 5 percent of trading volume to 20 percent , and maybe it will even rise to 2 5 percent next year. These are part-time investors, and given the complexity of the information involved, we have seen them drive prices far from reasonable fundamentals. In my opinion, the market will become less efficient in the short term before it becomes more efficient in the long term.",

Campbell Harvey: I think my research has had some impact in that it is nearly impossible for a job candidate to seek an assistant professorship in finance or economics on the basis of an empirical paper showing that a trading strategy or factor \u201cworks.\u201d That route is effectively gone. At the profession\u2019s top journals, almost always an economic foundation motivates the empirical exercise described in the article. Today, it is extremely difficult to get a paper published by simply doing some data analysis. I think we are moving in the right direction. Edward Baker: You founded the Duke CFO Global Business Outlook Survey. Surveys in general have quite good predictive power. How would you evaluate the efficacy of your survey, and what are your plans for future developments in that area? Campbell Harvey: I am a co-founder of the Duke CFO Survey. Part of my motive in starting the survey was that I thought we One of the costs of replication is that students, often master\u2019s program students, email to say: \u201cI tried to replicate your find - ing. It must be wrong because I can\u2019t replicate it.\u201d Then you waste time working with the student, who probably has made basic coding errors. Let\u2019s say we replicate a study one time and place the results in a public repository. When we run out of papers to replicate, new students in the second round of replication can deal with the students that did the first round of replication, rather than dealing with the original author. The new students might find mistakes in the old replications. That is a way to deal with this problem. Most of the journals have code -sharing policies now, and that\u2019s helpful. We do not have much replication in financial economics, mainly because most data is widely available. Those data are so easy to get that the cost of replication is pretty low, but the main point I made in my paper is that we need to reduce the cost of replication, we need to make it easier. The Journal of Finance now has a section for replication studies, which is a step forward; in fact, a replication paper I submitted, Harvey and Liu (2021), is forthcoming. (The paper is now posted on Social Science Research Network, or SSRN.) If senior people in the profession begin to do replications, it could change the culture. We need to change the culture, not just the attitude of researchers, but also the attitudes of people in the dean\u2019s office and others at the university who might regard a replication study as somehow inferior to another type of paper. In other sciences, replications are treated equally. Inna Okounkova: Maybe the industry can contribute as well\u2014 because quant shops do retest signals on different data, first, before deploying them. In many cases, in my experience, the signal does not work but it\u2019s kept silent. Campbell Harvey: You are correct that every day industry professionals pour over what is posted on SSRN. If they see an interesting finding, they send the paper out for replication; often the research works, but the academic ignores real-world frictions, such as trading costs. With reasonable trading costs, the effect may go away. Even with the research on 400 factors, no study (that I know of) includes trading costs. For example, a cross -sectional momentum strategy with 800- percent turn - over is going to be costly and will likely wipe out whatever alpha is reported. Replication is going on within the industry, but no one is inter - ested in sharing it because they want their competitors to waste resources doing the replication too. The same problem occurs in the pharmaceutical industry with ten firms conducting the same experiment, but nobody knows what anybody else is doing. A company might try fifty different signals and find that forty -eight do not work.",

HARVEy, PHD VOLUME 21 NUMBER 1 2022 9 JOURNAL OF INVESTMENT CONSULTINGEdward Baker: You\u2019ve used this survey for a long time to esti - mate the equity risk premium. What are the current surveys telling you about the equity risk premium? What estimates are you seeing, and what is your personal estimate, especially in the interest -rate environment we\u2019re in now? Campbell Harvey: The survey asks respondents to estimate the equity risk premium over one year and ten years. The ten-year premium is probably most relevant because it is used for longer -term asset allocation and for calculating the cost of capital. When we look at the yield spread between, let\u2019s say, the S&P 500 Index and a ten-year bond, historically that premium has floated between 2. 5 percent and 5 percent . Because we have a long sample, it is fairly smooth. Currently, the premium is around 3 percent , which suggests the market is not expecting an abnormal stock -bond relationship over the next ten years. The premium is a forecasted measure of what is expected to happen in the stock market relative to the bond market. Edward Baker: I\u2019d like to go back to your comment about the impact of retail investors on the markets these days and think about cryptocurrencies. I know you\u2019re in the process of publish - ing or have recently published a paper on that topic. What is your view about whether institutional investors should be including cryptocurrencies as part of their asset mix? Campbell Harvey: I have a full teaching deck on that question, but I will try to give a brief answer to your question. The crypto complex is currently worth $1.8 trillion. Apple is worth $2 tril - lion, about the same. A reasonable question is, would a globally diversified portfolio hold any Apple stock? Yes, of course. Should it hold some cryptocurrency? It is hard to make the case it should be excluded. People use the term \u201ccrypto\u201d broadly, but that\u2019s misleading because of the many types of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, makes up about 5 0 percent of crypto\u2019s total capitalization. The original vision was that bit - coin would be a transaction mechanism, but it turns out that is not practical. The current model makes bitcoin transactions too expensive and too slow to use widely, but it is useful for large transactions. Ethereum is a distributed computational platform that has spawned the world of decentralized finance, which I consider really exciting. In February 2021, someone moved $5.2 billion in bitcoin from one address to another, and the cost for that transaction was $17. That is amazing. Right now, however, bitcoin falls more in the category of a store of value. But the arguments I hear about why bitcoin should have a very high value do not make a lot of sense. The claim that bitcoin equals new gold is a logical fal - lacy. Gold has a value of $9 trillion. That means, with 21 mil - lion units of bitcoin, each bitcoin should be worth $400,000. The fallacy is that the result is arrived at by saying that bitcoin equals gold. were too siloed as academics. We were writing papers about how people act without talking to them. My idea was to get a group of chief executive officers and CFOs engaged and interact with them to learn about the practice of finance\u2014how they make decisions. Even if they are taking actions that are theoretically incorrect, that knowledge helps us think about that decision point in a different way. Ultimately, my motivation was twofold: to interact with practitioners directly and to iden - tify a tangible measure of expectations that could be used in other applications. In finance, our models are about expectations. The capital asset pricing model says that the expected excess return on a stock is proportional to the beta, which is multiplied by the expected risk premium.",

I was pleased that Andrei Shleifer used our data in an import - ant paper (Gennaioli et al. 2016) because his influence in eco - nomics is substantial. We have seen a shift in economics that actually considers expectations as a first-order item. Think of the survey results as new data we did not have before. We have collected these data over twenty -five years, and a number of papers are based on them. Most people in finance do not realize that the paper of mine that has had the most impact is not in finance; it is in accounting. The paper (Graham et al. 2015) is about earnings management. We asked a ques - tion related to how earnings were manipulated. The question was, \u201cWould you be willing to destroy firm value to smooth out your earnings and hit the target?\u201d That question purposely included a hot word\u2014\u201cdestroy.\u201d Including that word in a question is unusual. Number one, we would expect some inherent bias, such as \u201cOh, we would never do that.\u201d But using the word \u201cdestroy\u201d increases the bias. Our results were shocking. Seventy -eight percent of the CFOs agreed that they routinely destroyed value to smooth their earn - ings. This discovery changed the way we thought about earn - ings, smoothing, and manipulation. In accounting, earnings management was thought to be done with accruals, smoothing them by recognizing an amount early or late, but the CFOs said, no, we are not doing that because it is observable and we do not want to be called out for anything that looks like accounting shenanigans. We showed that they take other actions, such as slashing research and development spending, delaying or canceling investment projects, reducing advertis - ing, and delaying hiring. All these actions were originally planned because they yield positive net present values. A project is approved because it has a positive net present value. If canceled or delayed to manage earnings, the CFO is destroying value. Nothing about this is illegal, however; it is just a business decision. We were able to gain these types of insights by asking the CFOs directly about their practices. \u00a9 2022 Investments & Wealth Institute. Reprinted with permission.

Investing in crypto might mean investing in a store of value like bitcoin, or it might mean investing in a s table coin. But why do that if the crypto is linked to the dollar? Because it allows deposits in many of the protocols that offer a much higher sav - ings rate than is available from a traditional bank. Or it might mean investing in a governance token, which is almost like buying a piece of a startup in a different way; instead of invest - ing with equities, invest with tokens. In the future, diversified portfolios can be far more diversified because investors will be able to add assets to their portfolios they could not have added in the past. Illiquid assets, which are difficult to invest in, will be newly accessible. It is fairly obvious that stocks will be tokenized and we will trade the tokens, but the market for tokenizing private equity is really huge. Companies not yet public\u2014 pre-IPO [initial public offering] firms\u2014represent an illiquid market, but this technol - ogy offers the average investor the possibility of investing in these types of firms very early. The diversification possibilities are enormous, which is good for all investors and good for companies that are seeking financing.

Why has the convergence process taken so long? Will emerging markets ever converge, and is environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing part of that process? If emerging markets actually embraced global ESG standards, would that facilitate this process? Campbell Harvey: Some traditional emerging markets have become developed. The United States was an emerging market at some point, and now it is a developed market. This progres - sion from emerging to developed will continue. Eventually emerging markets will disappear (at least on this planet), and that is a good thing. But in the meantime, certain countries are just at the start of their financial development, and they offer special challenges, special risks, and special opportunities for investors. These markets do not move in lockstep with markets in the United States, but as a group they are more correlated today than they were, say, twenty years ago. The emerging markets provide diversification potential and the possibility of higher expected returns. Investors who are willing to take these risks will pursue those investments. Will there be crises? Yes. Will there be crashes? Yes. But with diversified portfolios, investors can hope to ride through those challenges. Robust equity markets provide much -needed In my recently released book, DeFi and the Future of Finance , I take a deep dive into what is happening in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Essentially, we have been operating in the world of centralized finance for 100 to 150 years. Even with the advent of computers, not much has changed. We have the same banking structure\u2014central banks, brokerages, insurance companies\u2014and the same business model we have had for years. Decentralized finance, however, totally changes the game. Saving and lending occurs between peers. DeFi has no overhead, no brick -and-mortar structures, so in DeFi savings rates go up, and borrowing rates go down. In this new world, the spread enforced by commercial banks basically disappears, which creates a substantial disruption. Exchanges are decentralized and trading occurs peer to peer with an algorithm. Much is going on under the radar screen. Those who simply focus on bitcoin and whether it should be in their portfolios are not seeing the scaffolding of a new city that is being built and that will completely change the way we conduct finance, a city where everybody is banked. Right now, 1.7 billion people in the world are unbanked, and the same number are probably underbanked. What do I mean by under - banked? Suppose I am an entrepreneur. I have a great idea that I think can yield a 20- percent return on investment. I go to the bank for a loan and they say my idea is great but they would prefer to have a large customer rather than 100 custom - ers like me. But the bank increases the credit limit on my credit card to cover the loan. However, the rate on the credit card is 20 percent . Consequently, I will never pursue that project. With this new technology, finance is a lot more democratic. Many people in the middle are eliminated. Anybody can pur - sue projects that have high rates of return\u2014the types of projects that can deliver substantial economic growth. Right now we are essentially stuck in 2- percent , maybe 3- percent , real GDP growth. DeFi gives us the possibility of reducing the financial constraints that exist today, opening up the possibility of much higher growth. Ideally, no one should be prevented from pursu - ing an opportunity that is a good idea. The door should be open for someone to finance it. We are heading toward a world where everything is tokenized, and the mainstream media are finally covering more than just bitcoin\u2014for example, nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, which toke - nize unique items. We sometimes call them deeds. The item could be a piece of art, a contract, a loan\u2014any unique asset. We take basic economics courses as undergraduates or even as PhD students.

The next time the firm is considering investing\u2014or possibly another company is considering investing for the first time in that country\u2014they remember the country\u2019s track record; the risk premium associated with that country goes up and consequently less money comes in. There is an equilibrating process, but the problem is that politicians are not necessarily in office for the long term. Often, they make decisions that look good in the short term but cost the country in the long term. This is a problem in the United States, where the regulatory horizon is typically between two and six years. Edward Baker: It makes politicians sound like CFOs. Campbell Harvey: Yes, that is exactly the case. Short -termism is a fundamental problem with our political system and with the way businesses are run. Ludwig Chincarini: May I turn us to the topic of crowding? You recently wrote a paper, Arnott et al. (2019), with Rob Arnott on the crowding of factors. Then you wrote a very good paper, Harvey et al. (2020), about fund structure. What\u2019s your primary takeaway from your research into crowding? Campbell Harvey: I am increasingly sympathetic to the Berk and Green (2004) idea that we should not look at fund manager alpha after all expenses. They argue that we need to consider the gross return of funds, before fees. Even if fund investors earn zero alpha, managers are being paid. Consider the incen - tives in this situation if we assume a fixed dollar amount of alpha. An asset manager who has a limited amount of assets under management could distribute some of that alpha to her investors, but with a much larger amount of assets under man - agement, distributing that fixed amount of alpha would cause it to eventually go to zero. That scenario is relatively consistent with what we observe in mutual funds, for example, when the alpha (after fees) is essentially zero across the complex. We could call this crowding. Essentially, the asset manager is not establishing boundaries, not imposing limits. The asset manager takes more capacity than is feasible for a particular strategy in order to get more assets under management. The average alpha is lower as a result. Again, it is a matter of capital for emerging markets so they can move more rapidly toward becoming developed markets. I feel quite positive about emerging markets in general, because with technological change the growth of these markets will accelerate. Many people in these countries cannot access schools or even the internet, but that is changing. Eventually, everybody in the world will have free internet. Everybody will have some sort of smartphone. That means they can become part of the \u201cinternet of value,\u201d and those who are ambitious can realize their dreams. I think we will see substantial growth\u2014much higher growth in emerging markets than in developed markets\u2014and historically we have learned that what is good for emerging markets is also good for developed markets. Regarding the second part of your question, I am nervous about a company selling an ESG investment product that promises \u201cESG alpha.\u201d Asset managers point to 2020 and say, \u201cLook, these ESG -friendly stocks did really well.\u201d True, prices went up in 2020, appearing to validate the ESG investment thesis, but what does that mean? We know that often as prices go up, expected return goes down. I think many investors will be disappointed. Plenty of greenwashing is going on.5 Some managers are more concerned about getting investors to allocate capital to their funds than the quality of the products they are offering.

The G component has extremely diverse interpretations, and the same is true for S. These themes are difficult for quantitative finance to measure. We might be able to quantify some level of carbon impact, so I think most of the investing will be in the E component. Still, I worry that many ESG investments are oversold. To get ESG alpha, a backtest is concocted, perhaps with data mining and overfitting. The backtest looks good, but investors likely will be disappointed by the performance out of sample. Edward Baker: I was alluding more to government policy and government\u2019s ability to destroy value, especially on the G side, by implementing policies that hurt foreign investors. I think emerging markets have a long history of experiencing prob - lems of this sort. Turkey is a recent example. Campbell Harvey: Government policy that destroys value is not just a problem in emerging markets. If regulation is too harsh, companies just go offshore. If regulation is too weak, consumers are exploited. The regulators who formulate these policies should be making a big investment to get the right balance. This regulatory dilemma is apparent not only in emerging markets. A situation could arise in an emerging market involving some sort of expropriation.

The proportion of hedge funds capable of delivering good performance is far larger. Even though thou - sands of hedge funds have little or no ability to deliver good performance, some certainly can. Geoffrey Gerber: I\u2019d like to discuss asset allocation related to your research on negative convexity. Compared to a buy-and- hold portfolio containing a 60/40 ratio of stocks and bonds, you induce negative convexity and give up return by selling to rebalance. We know that from a statistical standpoint, you reduce risk by rebalancing; you reduce risk by going back to your target portfolio. So from the standpoint of a Sharpe ratio, is there a sweet spot? What advice would you give someone doing asset allocation relative to a 60/40 target? When do you move back, or do you just not move back? Campbell Harvey: Investment finance has two pillars: diversifi - cation and rebalancing. These concepts are so basic that almost everyone in finance thinks they understand them. In reality, diversification is poorly understood because many investors think of diversification as reducing variance, but risk involves more than variance. My 2000 Journal of Finance paper argued that, at a minimum, we need three dimensions. The downside needs to be taken into account. Consider two investments: one with a high Sharpe ratio and one with a lower Sharpe ratio. The higher Sharpe ratio investment may not be the better choice because it might have a giant downside tail. Rebalancing seems really simple. For example, start with a 60/40 portfolio and do not deviate from the 60/40 ratio by periodic rebalancing. The idea of course is that rebalancing allows for greater diversification. If the portfolio just runs with no rebalanc - ing, eventually the equity portion would be 9 9 percent , and the portfolio would simply be an equity bet with no meaningful bond exposure. The 60/40 capitalization -weighted portfolio does not really have a 60/40 ratio in terms of risk or variance; that ratio is closer to 90/10. Nevertheless, let\u2019s go with 60/40. The first result is that mechanical rebalancing to 60/40 induces bigger drawdowns. The reason is simple.",

Buying in a falling market is akin to dynamically replicating a short put option. Conversely, selling in a rising market replicates a short call option. Put the two actions together and the outcome is a short straddle, which has, by definition, negative convexity. So, rebalancing is like adding a short straddle to a 60/40 portfolio and that short straddle induces extra risk. I have been interested in rebalancing for quite a while. In a paper called \u201cStrategic Rebalancing\u201d (Rattray et al. 2019) as well as my new book, Strategic Risk Management (Harvey et al. incentives. Although crowding is important, measuring it pre - cisely is difficult. Many years ago, I was a scientific advisor for a major U.S. pension plan. When I did due diligence on alterna - tive asset managers, such as hedge funds, one of the things I looked for was how many of a manager\u2019s funds were not allowing any new investment. That discipline is necessary for an investor to make any excess return. The crowding paper you mentioned is in the review process. It has an interesting angle\u2014that as the money comes in, an indi - vidual manager has a limited capacity for generating new ideas. We show that the so-called decreasing returns of scale\u2014which means lower alpha with more assets under management\u2014are mitigated when we move from a single asset manager to a team of asset managers, where more than one person is coming up with new ideas. We also show that diversity is important in terms of the background and expertise of that team. If the team is just a replica of the original solo manager, adding managers is not much help. Although these are characteristics investors can consider, crowding is definitely a phenomenon that nega - tively affects performance. Mark Anson: I\u2019d like to go back to your comment about mutual fund returns. Another of your great papers was \u201cLuck versus Skill in the Cross -Section of Mutual Fund Returns,\u201d in which you re-examined the evidence and reconciled the economic results presented by Kosowski et al. (2006) and the results pre - sented by Fama and French (2010). I think you found that Fama and French under -rejected the null hypothesis as zero alpha and Kosowski over -rejected it. Then you did a reconciliation of their sampling methods and explained why that would be the case. But coming back to the comment you just made, your paper remains silent on your belief regarding the ability of mutual funds to generate alpha. Can you offer some insight? Campbell Harvey: Great question. You are referring to the replication paper that is forthcoming in the Journal of Finance . Fama and French essentially said there is no alpha, and Kosowski et al. said there is. Both papers used bootstrapping techniques\u2014so what was going on? It turns out this replication exercise was a computational nightmare. It was the first time I did a large -scale deployment to a cloud computing platform. Someone reading that paper would have no idea of the compu - tational power behind it. We implemented both sets of authors\u2019 bootstrapping techniques and found that both have issues. I think our paper will be useful going forward, because both papers are cited frequently by authors who just pull them off the shelf to make their inferences. You asked my opinion about the ability of mutual funds to generate alpha. My opinion is that likely a small proportion of mutual funds are able to outperform benchmarks after fees\u2014 probably in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent . It is a really low number, and it is hard to find those funds. The way I see it, a \u00a9 2022 Investments & Wealth Institute. Reprinted with permission.

We really care about an inflation surprise. Expected inflation is incorporated in bond yields, so our focus is on unexpected inflation because asset prices respond to unexpected inflation or changes in expected inflation. In comparing the various assets, we observe that in rising infla - tion fixed income investments get hammered like equities, and long -duration fixed income instruments do the worst. But other dynamic strategies are interesting to examine. Given that inflation risk has increased, I think it is incumbent on asset managers to re-examine the positioning of their port - folios. In June 2019 I declared that we had experienced one quarter of yield -curve inversion, and that my indicator had correctly predicted seven out of seven recessions. Because we know recessions are often associated with negative equity returns, I recommended then that investors re-examine their portfolios\u2019 positioning and take appropriate steps. The investors who took that advice did well. Today, the risk of inflation has increased substantially\u2014the 2020 deficit was $3.2 trillion; the actual size of the debt grew by more than $4 trillion because of so-called off\u2013balance -sheet debt. The deficit for 2021 will be more than $2 trillion. The size of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet is dramatically larger today than it was a year and a month ago (i.e., larger today than it was in February 2020). When we put all this together, it suggests risk. Perhaps the coun - terargument is that QE and deficits during the Global Financial Crisis were not really inflationary. In the year-over -year break in 2009, inflation did go above 5 percent briefly, but quickly moder - ated. That is a single observation. The size of the stimulus, the size of the QE, are much larger today. Even if the inflation fore - cast is 2 to 2. 2 percent and is unchanged from a year ago, the risk is higher. Given the probability of higher inflation, it is time to reposition portfolios. ENDNOTES 1. Eugene F.

Why not just fit a simple trend -following model? If the trend -following model suggests the market is continuing to trend down, delay the rebalance. Use that information to stra - tegically time the rebalancing. Historically, this strategy has been very effective. Importantly, waiting to rebalance does not cost anything. The models we present are incredibly simple\u2014models for three -month momentum or twelve -month momentum\u2014and are straightforward to implement. The payoff is substantial in that the size of the drawdown is reduced when compared with the drawdown from using a mechanical strategy.

Insights from the Theory of Planned Behaviour F.C. Billari*, M. Gentile**, N. Linciano**, F. Saita*** Abstract Despite the importance that policy-makers acknowledge to financial education, little is known about the demand for financial literacy (especially among the least literate individuals). We here build on the social-psychological framework of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to study the intention to learn more about savings and investments as a functi on of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control, also controlling for individual background factors, including psychological traits. We develop a novel TPB-based module for the CONSOB 2018 Survey on financial investments by Italian households, administered to 1,601 individuals. Analyses of this module, also through structural equation models, show that attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control are significant determi- nants of intentions to learn more about savings and investments, as predicted by TPB. Differences in attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioura l control contribute to financial literacy gaps for women and less literate individuals in general. In anal ogy to other fields, interventions in the area of financial literacy should also target the determinants of individuals\u2019 intentions, especially for adults that are generally involved in financial ed ucation programs on a voluntary basis.

Insights from the Theory of Planned Behaviour 1 Introduction and motivation The ability of the average individual to make conscious and well-informed decisions over savings, expenditures, borrowing and retirement planning has become more and more important over time, also as a consequence of the increasing complexity of the economic and financial system (Hastings, Madrian and Skimmyhorn 2013, Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). The resp onsibility for long-term investment decisions increasingly rests on individuals, given the structural changes in pension systems that tend to become less generous also with rising life expectancy. Stricter regulation on product tran sparency and intermediaries\u2019 rules of conduct aimed at improving the quality of in teractions between financial institutions and clients may help, along with the creati on of simple default products. It is however unquestionable that raising the le vel of financial literacy, or knowledge 1, of the population is a key goal for the good functioning of markets and the achievement of desirable social outcomes. The 2007-2008 financial crisis has shown that individuals who are educated to make more conscious and long-term oriented saving, borrowing and investment decisions can contri bute to reducing financial risks, both at the individual level and the systemic leve l. In addition, it is important to fill the financial knowledge gaps among groups within the population, which penalise the relatively poorer and weaker segments of the population, particularly vulnerable to economic downturn, as this could also he lp to reduce economic inequalities (Hung, Yoong and Brown 2012).",

        "content": "Finally, improving financial knowledge is an essential component of the toolbox of financial regu lators and supervisors, as it may be a precondition for the effectiveness of regulation. There is in fact abundant evidence that financial literacy is with desirable financial behaviours. Individuals with higher level of knowledge tend to have higher stock market participation (Christelis, Jappe lli, and Padula 2010; van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie 2011; Arrondel, Debbich, and Sa vignac 2012). Financial literacy is also correlated with retirement planning, as it has been show n by evidence both from the US (see in particular Lusardi and Mitchell 2007a, Lusardi and Mitchell 2007b) and from other countries (see for instance Alme nberg and S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh 2011, Klapper and Panos 2011, Fornero and Monticone 2015) . Symmetrically, individuals with low financial knowledge may engage in more costly borrowing (Moore 2003, Mottola 2013, Lusardi and Tufano 2015). While financial literacy is undoubtedly desirable, actual knowledge tends to be low and to vary substantially by ge nder, age, and other markers of social stratification (see in particular Lusardi and Mitchell 2014 for a thorough review of existing evidence and Hung, Yoong and Brown 2012 for a specific focus on gender differences in financial literacy). The evidence of these gaps has prompted policy- makers around the world to engage in th e enhancement of financial literacy, also through the definition of nati onwide strategies (OECD, 2015). 1 In what follows we use \u2018financial knowle dge\u2019 and \u2018financial literacy\u2019 as synonyms. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3494984 8 Quaderni di finanza N. 88 novembre 2019Generally, the discussion about how to enhance financial literacy is focused on how to offer financial education programs. Less attention has been devoted so far to the demand for financial education by individuals and to the elements that may influence their intentions to increase fi nancial knowledge. This issue is however gaining momentum in the policy debate, as institutions engaged in financial education are becoming increasingly aware th at one of the biggest challenges is to transform knowledge into behaviour, and that this transformation rests on individu- als\u2019 motivation. Understanding the factors that may trigger personal engagement in the learning process is therefore key. The aim of this paper is precisely to investigate the determinants of the intention to become more financially literate, which can be considered as the measure of an individual\u2019s demand for financial education. From a policy perspective, studying the intentions to become (more) finan- cially literate is important, first because (as already mentioned) the effectiveness of any financial education policy is intertwined with the willingness of the beneficiary individuals and groups to actively engage in their education. Secondly, given that these intentions may depend on different fa ctors, it is important to identify the elements that matter the most in shaping them. Finally, understan ding intentions is relevant in order to appreciate whether diffe rences in the levels of financial literacy among population subgroups are also with a different intensity of the intention to learn about finance. If disadvantaged su bgroups are less interested in becoming financially literate, then part of the effort should be devoted not only to offer them chances for financial education but also to increase their willingness to take full advantage of these chances. In order to identify the determinants of the intention to increase one\u2019s own financial literacy, we make use of the frame work of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1988, 1991). The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB from now onwards) has been developed in the field of social psyc hology and subsequently extensively applied in several domains to predict behaviours that depend on purposive, intentional actions. To our knowledge, only a few pape rs apply this conceptual framework to analyse the intention to make certai n financial decisions (East, 1993, Lau et al., 2001, Shih and Fang, 2004, Cucinelli et al., 2017, Nosi et al., 2017), but none has specifical- ly dealt with the intention to learn more about finance and with potential differences across population subgroups. According to the TPB, the intention to perform a given behaviour (in our case, learning more about finance and investments) is the main trigger of a behaviour.",

        "content": "This behavioural intent ion is essentially driven by attitudes (i.e, the perceived costs and benefits associated with the behaviour), subjective norms (i.e., the perception of the social pressure to perform, or not to perform, a behaviour deriving from the opinions of \u2019important others\u2019), and perceived behavioural control (i.e., the perceived ease or difficulty of performing a behaviour). The background characteristics of an individual may in turn affect attitudes, su bjective norms, and perceived behavioural control, and at times directly behavioural intentions. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3494984 9 Who intends to become financially literate? Insights from the Theory of Planned Behaviour We build on the conceptual framework of the TPB to develop a specific module within the 2018 wave of the CONS OB Survey on financial investments of Italian households (also CONSOB 2018 Survey from now onwards). The Survey provides data on a representa tive sample of 1,601 individual decision-makers, i.e. the higher income earner in the family, and the background factors \u2013 such as gender, age, trust and other psychological traits \u2013 that can influence individuals\u2019 attitudes, norms and behavioural control, which are found to be associated with households\u2019 level of debt and assets (Brown and Tayl or 2014), stock market participation (Conlin et al. 2015) and propensity to save and bo rrow (Roa, Garron and Barboza, forthcom- ing). As a preview of our findings, analyses suggest that the TPB can be a power- ful model to explain individuals\u2019 intent ions to learn more about finance and investments. Attitudes, norms and percei ved behavioural control result to be statistically and substantially significant in explaining behavioural intentions, even after controlling for education and a number of background factors, including gender, age, trust, psychological traits. With the exception of perceived behavioural control, this holds true even when the analysis is replicated separately across gender subsamples. Secondly, despite the survey is targeted to the higher income earner in the family who is also likely to have a larger influence on household finance and investment decisions, the full sample model shows that women tend to display a lower intention to learn about finance and investments than men. In addition, there are clear differences in attitudes, subjecti ve norms and perceived behavioural control among individuals with different levels of financial literacy. Based on our approach that allows to distinguish the role of (non- modifiable) background factors and the role of attitudes, subjective norms and behavioural control, we discuss the direct ions that can be followed to influence individual intentions to increase financial literacy. Our results also suggest that policy efforts aimed not only at providing opportuni ties to learn but also at strengthening the intention to learn are equally important when trying to fill the gender gap in financial literacy. Overall, we believe that our methodological approach can help shedding light on a crucial component (individuals\u2019 demand for financial education) that has received so far limited attention. The remainder of this paper is struct ured as follows. Section 2 briefly re- views the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Section 3 describes our data and methods. Section 4 presents the estimation results on the determinants of the intention to learn more about finance and inve stments. Section 5 concludes. 2 The Theory of Planned Behaviour The Theory of Planned Behaviour was introduced by the social psychologist Icek Ajzen (Ajzen, 1988, 1991) as an extensi on of the earlier \u2018Theory of Reasoned Action\u2019 by Fishbein and Ajzen (1975). Accord ing to the TPB, the performance of a Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3494984 10 Quaderni di finanza N. 88 novembre 2019specific behaviour is jointly determined by the intention to perform the behaviour and actual behavioural control, i.e. the actu al ability to perform the behaviour. First, TPB extends the earlier Theory of Reasoned Action by assuming that not only a behavioural intention is the key antecedent of a behaviour, but that the actual performance of a specific behaviour can al so depend on the individual\u2019s perceived and actual behavioural control. Intuitively, the relative role of behavioural intentions and behavioural control can vary depending on the behaviour (consider for instance the difference between the ordering a soft drink and ceasing to smoke).",

        "content": "Secondly, according to the TPB framework, the determin ants of behavioural intentions can be identified in attitudes (i.e. perceived costs and benefits), subjective norms (i.e. the perception of the degree to which \u2019important others\u2019 approve or disapprove the specific behaviour), and perceived behavioura l control. In turn, these factors can be influenced by background factors. Figure 1 sketches a simplified representation of the TPB. The TPB framework has been tested exte nsively since its early years and has proved to perform well in a number of app lications (see for instance the early meta- analytic review by Armitage and Conner, 2001). The TPB has only rarely been applied (and often on small samples) to financial behaviour and decisions, for instance in modelling the decision to apply for shares in cases of privatization (East, 1993), the intention of using either Internet bankin g or online trading (Lau, Yen and Chau 2001, Shih and Fang 2004), the intention of retail investors to apply for medium- or high-risk financial products (Cucinelli, Gandolfi and Soana 2016), and the intention to become an entrepreneur (von Graevenitz, Harhoff and Weber 2010). Yet, to our knowledge, the TPB has never been applied to the intention to increase the level of one\u2019s own financial literacy. In what follows, we build on the TPB ap proach to assess the determinants of an individual\u2019s intention to improve his or her financial literacy, i.e. attitudes, subjective norms and perceived control. Following Ajzen (1991), we evaluate attitudes by combining two elements: the subjective probability that the behaviour Figure 1 \u2013 A schematic presentation of the Theory of Planned Behaviour Source: Fishbein and Ajzen, 2005, p. 194.

Insights from the Theory of Planned Behaviour will produce a certain outcome (a benefit or a cost), and the perceived desirability of that outcome (outcome evaluation). Simila rly, subjective norms, i.e. the social pressure that an individual may (or may not) perceive in learning more about savings and investments, result from the combinatio n of the strength of normative beliefs (which are linked with the likelihood th at \u2018important others\u2019 may approve or disapprove a given behaviour) and the importance attributed to the evaluation of each \u2018important other\u2019 (i.e., the motivati on to comply to others\u2019 expectations and opinions). Perceived behavioural control is measured here directly and aims at capturing the individual perceived ability to perform the behaviour (i.e., learning more about finance and investments). 3 Data and methods 3.1 The CONSOB 2018 Survey We draw our data from the CONSOB 2018 Survey (formally \u2018The approach to finance and investment of Italian households\u2019), administered by GfK Italia to a representative sample of Italian retail fi nancial decision-makers. For the purpose of the Survey, a \u2019financial decision-maker\u2019 is defined as the primary family income earner (or the oldest male member, when nobody works, or the oldest female member, when there are no male family members), aged between 18 and 74 (bank employees, insurance company employees an d financial advisors are not included). The definition of the financial decision-maker may not capture the actual decision- making process within the households, as financial choices may result from the interaction among household members (e.g., among the spouses). However, there is empirical evidence supporting the relation be tween personal earnings and the role in household financial decision-making (Jo hnston, Kassenboehmer and Shields 2016). Sample descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1. One the basis of our descriptive statis tics, Italian financial decision-makers are mainly middle-aged men, living in the No rth. Their level of education is generally under the bachelor\u2019s degree (82%). Indeed, 42% of respondents attended either only the primary or also the secondary school (\u2019less than high school\u2019 dummy variable), 40% declare to hold the high school dipl oma (\u2019high school\u2019 dummy variable), while 18% hold at least a bachelor\u2019s degree (\u2019at least bachelor\u2019s degree\u2019 dummy variable).",

Answers are expressed on a 5-point Likert scale (from 1 - \u2018strongly agree\u2019 to 5 - \u2018strongly disagree\u2019). Following the TPB approach, intentions are regarded as dependent on three latent variables: attitudes (i.e. one\u2019s ow n overall evaluation of the behaviour), subjective norms (expressing the perceived social pressure in favour or against the behaviour) and perceived behavioural control (i.e. perception of one\u2019s own ability to enact the behaviour). Attitudes are gathered through two components: beliefs about the consequences of learning more (behavioural beliefs) and judgments about these consequences (outcome evaluation). Subjective norms are measured with bo th the individual perception about how other people would like the person to behave, and the individual consideration of other people\u2019s opinion, where proximal people may be the partner, relatives, friends and colleagues. Finally, perceived behavioural control is measured by gathering control beliefs regarding learning more about savings and investments. The above-mentioned constructs are elicited thro ugh multiple answer questions, requiring respondents to score their own preferences on a 5-point Likert scale (Table 4). For each of the psychological constructs (atti tudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control) items were presente d to respondents in a random order. Let us turn now to some descriptive st atistics. As for the components of the \u2018attitude\u2019 towards learning more about savi ngs and investments, the item related to behavioural beliefs recording the highest perc entage of agreement is a sort of need for cognition (i.e., \u2018learning more about savings and investments would be a way to learn new things\u2019), while the outcome evalua tion gathering the highest agreement is \u2018saving\u2019, along with \u2018avoiding unne cessary expenses\u2019 (Figure 2). As for subjective norms, the strongest individual source of pressure appears to be the \u2018partner\u2019 for both components (i .e., the individual perception about how people would like the person to behave and the individual consideration of people\u2019s opinion; Figure 3). 3 The Survey also elicited intention in a generalized format, i.e. without specifying any time horizon, with the following question: \u2018I intend to le arn more about savings and investments\u2019. We verified that using the generic intention as dependent variable does not significantly ch ange the econometric results (estimates available upon request).

According to the TPB, however, they are psychological constructs and should be more accurately considered as latent factors, which can be measured through a set of items measured, in turn , through multiple answer questions. The so-called confirmatory factor analys is (CFA analysis) allows to treat at- titudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control as latent factors, which influence the answers to multiple item questions (Figure 5).

The graph represents the relation between the latent factor and the items of the question used for measurement. When multiple latent factors are considered, CFA allows to account for both the possible correlation among the latent factors and the possible correlation among the measurement errors of the items due to noise in survey responses (Figure 6).

In addition, the CFA enables to treat the non-linearity of the causal rela- tionship among latent factors and respon dents\u2019 answers. Indeed, given that, as already mentioned in Table 4, answers are gi ven on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 (i.e., from \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 to \u2018strongly agree\u2019), response variables are discrete categorical variables that can be best an alysed through an ordinal probit model. Finally, the CFA analysis can be included in a more general model of the in- tention to perform a given behaviour by simultaneously estimating the causal relationships between latent factors and the corresponding item responses on one side, and the relationship among intentions and latent factors on the other side. To simultaneously model these relationships, we apply the CFA to move, as a second step, to a more general structural equa tion modelling (Generalized Structural Equation Model - GSEM), where the non-lin ear links between atti tudes, subjective Latent factor item 1 item 2 item 3 ... item N \u03b5_N \u03b51 \u03b52 \u03b53 Latent factor 1 item 1 item 2 item 3 \u03b51 \u03b52 \u03b53Latent factor 2 item 4 item 5 \u03b54 \u03b55 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3494984 22 Quaderni di finanza N. 88 novembre 2019norms, perceived behavioural control and in tentions are also estimated through an ordered probit model as they are elicited on a Likert scale (Figure 7).",

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3494984 26 Quaderni di finanza N. 88 novembre 2019Estimation results allow us to rank the items according to the strength of their linkage with latent factors. In deta ils, the main contributor to the attitude towards improvement of one\u2019s own financial knowledge is att1 (\u2018help me to save\u2019) while the least relevant is att4 (\u2018learning would be boring\u2019 reverse coded). As for subjective norms and perceived control, no rm4 (\u2018colleagues\u2019) and pbc2 (\u2018I don\u2019t know who can help me/the source of information\u2019) are respectively the most relevant items. Lastly, while the covariance, between a ttitudes and subjective norms is sig- nificant and positive, covariances between perceived behavioural control and the other two psychological constructs are significantly negative (all at 1% level) 6. One possible interpretation of this empirica l evidence is that more overconfident individuals are more likely to display both less positive attitudes towards learning and higher perceived behavioural co ntrol. Analyses using simple t-tests provide empirical support to this interpretation. Following Broihanne et al. (2014), we define individuals as overconfident ( underconfident ) if the sign of the difference between the self- reported number of correct answers to fina ncial literacy questions and the number of actual correct answers is positive (negativ e). Based on this definition, the attitude towards learning of overconfident respondents is on average lower (at a 1% significance level) than that of underco nfident ones. On the other hand, perceived behavioural control of overconfident respondents is on average higher (at a 10% significance level) than th at of underconfident ones. 4.2 Intentions to learn more a bout savings and investments: results from the SEM Let us now turn to the joint estimation of the relationship among the inten- tion to improve one\u2019s own financial kn owledge in a time-specific horizon and attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control) (Figure 7). The GSEM allows to jointly estimate both the structural part and the latent building block of our model with a high level of flexibility. The specification of the model also includes some background factors, added on the basis of the already underlined exogeneity criterion: age, education, gender, generaliz ed trust and psychological traits such as extroversion, openness, consciousness, agreeableness and emotional stability 7. Given that the intention to learn about savings and investments is a discrete variable which ranges from 1 to 5, we apply anordered probit model.",

Atti- tudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control are significant determi-nants of the intention to learn more about savings and investments. However, the incidence of the attitudes is higher than th e influence of subjective norms and, above all, than the impact of perceived behaviou ral control. Among the background factors, psychological traits and gender tend to ha ve a significant influence on the willing- ness to learn finance. The effect of gend er and financial knowledge will be deeply analysed in the following section th rough a group comparison analysis. 4.3 Group comparisons by gender and financial literacy level Group comparison by gender shows that the intention to learn about sav- ings and investments differs signific antly among men and women.

Despite the smaller size of the fema le subsample (396 individuals), which has to be taken into account when interp reting results, attitudes and subjective norms are still statistically significant, wi th coefficients being very similar across subsamples.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3494984 29 Who intends to become financially literate? Insights from the Theory of Planned Behaviour 5 Conclusions Policy-makers over the world are increasingly engaged in the delivery of financial education, in the attempt to trigger sound financial choices that can ultimately enhance individual wellbeing. Ra ising the level of financial literacy is extremely important to help individuals, and especially the least literate ones, managing their budget more consciously, avoiding painful mistakes due to inappropriate borrowing or investment decisions, and elaborating a proper and timely pension planning. Financial education initiatives may target both beneficiaries that can be reached regardless of their will (this is the ca se of school students as the decision to join the program is typically made by the si ngle teacher or by the school/institution) and groups, such as adults, that may decide whether to engage or not. In this paper we argue that the poten tial effectiveness of the delivery of financial education is also linked to demand-side factors, and in particular individuals\u2019 intentions to learn more about fi nance, which is a prerequisite in order to be able to transpose new knowledge into habits and hence behaviour. Understanding what lies behind intentions to become fina ncially literate is therefore a precondition to consider how to increase these intentions, as a first key step. This is especially true with respect to adults, who are more difficult to target and to reach (unless specific initiatives are undertaken, particularly in the work place). Despite the fact that intentions to learn more about finance can be a crucial element influencing the commitment of individuals when offered a financial education program at school, and even more in deciding to participate or not in voluntary programs as adults, the determinants of the intention to become financially literate has received very little attention so far.",

        "content": "Much more attention has been paid on how to structure the supply of financial education program (which clearly is a key issue from a policy-making perspective) rather than on the determinants of (and the potential interventions on) the demand for financial education. The key focus of this paper is ther efore understanding the intention to become more financially literate. We impl ement a module building on Ajzen\u2019s (1988, 1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour in the CONSOB 2018 survey and subsequently analyse data on a stratified sample of 1,601 financial decision-makers in Italy. Our findings support the view that th e TPB can be a powerful model to ex- plain individuals\u2019 intentions to learn more about finance and investments. In fact, attitudes, norms and perceived behavioura l control are important determinants of intentions, even when controlling for psych ological traits, trust, age, gender and education. In addition, TPB-based constructs continue to be statistically significant also when analysing gender subsamples, wi th the exception of perceived behavioural control in the women subsample. Our paper also delves deeper in the problem of women\u2019s lower financial lit- eracy, which is noteworthy in many countries and particularly strong in Italy (see Consob\u2019s Report and, among the others , Hasler and Lusardi 2017; Bottazzi and Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3494984 30 Quaderni di finanza N. 88 novembre 2019Lusardi 2016 show that a strong gender gap is highlighted by OECD PISA data even at the age of 15). In fact, according to ou r analyses women display (everything else being equal) a significantly lower intention to learn about finance and investments than men. This gap in intentions is particularly remarkable if we consider (i) that our interviewees are the primary income earner s in the family (and in more than two- thirds these are men), and (ii) that abou t 75% of the 396 women in the sample are single decision-makers, and should theref ore be more motivated to gain a greater control on personal finance than other female non-primary income earners. This difference is even stronger when considering only women with financial literacy equal to or lower than the median. Wh en comparing attitudes and perceived behavioural control between men and women, women show a slightly more positive attitude towards becoming more financially literate, but they also show a lower level of perceived behavioural control. We also compared the total impact on intentions of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and background factors across individuals with lower-than-median and higher-than-median financial literacy. The subgroup with lower financial literacy show a higher sensitivity to subjective norms relative to the higher financial literacy subgroup, i.e. they feel a stronger social pressure to improve their level of literacy. However, the less literate also record lower levels of attitude and perceived behavioural control, i.e. in relative terms they perceive less the benefits of becoming financially literate, and they are less confident about their ability to become more literate. On policy grounds, it is clearly important to understand which levers could be used to increase the intention to le arn about finance and investment for the whole population and more so for the le ss literate and therefore weaker groups. Based on our results, possible intervention s could ideally be focused on attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. Here, we could learn from other fields in which interventions have been informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour, such as health. Such levers include fo r example the provision of information, increasing skills and persuading individuals on the possibility of performing a specific behaviour, encouraging planning, providin g social support for a behaviour. These interventions might affect attitudes, subj ective norms, and perceived behavioural control, intentions and finally behaviour, as documented by recent meta-analyses by Sheeran et al. (2016) and Steinmetz et al. (2016). Broadly speaking, differences in atti tudes, norms, perceived behavioural control across subgroups suggest that in or der to reduce financial literacy gaps (as policy-makers try to do) addressing intention gaps first can be important.",

Most of the studies conclude that women invest more conservatively than m en (Yao, R. & Hanna, S.D., 2005 ) and that the women are more risk averse ( Julie R. Agnew , 2005 ). Some studies also contend that women are less confident about their investment decisions and earn less return in compare to men (Barber B and Odean T., 2001 ). In this context, this paper aims to study whether these gender differences really exist in India. Using NCAER household survey report, the paper examined the household investing and saving patterns of Indian investors. The gender difference has been studie d in terms of their risk tolerance viz their risk bearing capacity, risk perception i.e. how they assume risk within different constraints, time horizon for investment, preference for investment alternatives among the vast number of alternatives available in the Indian capital market etc. We also examined the factors which influence the investment behaviour of women such as age, level of education, their marital status, income, dependency etc. JEL Classification: J16, G11, G23 Keywords: Gender Difference , Risk perception, Investment Behaviour, Women Investment. Introduction: After the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, the Indian financial sector has now emerged stronger. The investments and savings are increasing in terms of volumes and number of investors. As the number of investors is increasing, the most common discussion based on gender biasness again becomes the interest of investors. There are number of studies , which have shown that the financial behaviour of men and women differ significan tly. Women hold low risk tolerance i.e. are more risk averse than men and also sometimes earns less returns from their investments. Except this, w omen invest more Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2358344 Electronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2358344 conservatively their financial resources and have shows low confidence regarding their financ ial behaviour. In this paper we are studying the investment behaviour of individuals, residing in the territory of India, dividing them in the strata of male and female with reference to their preference for investment alternative, their risk behaviour, th e level of confidence regarding their financial decisions, the factors which influence their behaviour , etc. Literature Review: There are number of studies available, which have discussed the difference in financial behaviour of male and female investors and the factors which influence this behaviour. Researchers like Suden et al. (1998) Julie R. Agnew (2005 ), Perrin (2007), Oslen and Cox(2001), Schmidt & Sevak (2006) shows that women are more risk averse then men in general and this defines their choice of less risky assets in their portfolios. Except this, Guiso, Jappelli and Terlizzese (1996), Bajtelsmit and VanDerhei (1997), Hariharan, Chapman and Domain (2000), Hartog, Ferrer -I-Carbonell and Jonker (2002) concluded that males are more risk tolerant t han females. Powell & Ansic (1997) find that men have significantly higher preference for risk than women. Males prefer \u201criskier\u201d investment strategies in order to achieve the highest gains, while women select \u201csafer\u201d strategies that allow them avoiding th e worst possible losses [ Odean (1998), Barber and Odean (2001), Benartzi and Thaler (2001), Gervais and Odean (2001), and Daniel and Huberman (2003)]. Graham (2002) found that women have less confidence regarding their decision related to financial issues . Fellner & Maciejovsky (2007 ) reveal a systematic correlation between gender and risk attitudes. Further Fellner & Maciejovsky (2007) find that women prefer less volatile investments and exhibit lower market activity, e.g. they submit fewer offers and eng age less often in trades. Women give a lot of priority and importance to the advices given by Financial Advisors (FA) and depend on them for guidance than men. Female investors are more detail oriented; and want to read more and understand financial matter s better and they ask more questions than male clients (Worley, 1998).",

        "content": "Jianakoplos & Bernasek (1998) test gender differences in investment behaviour on a large data set drawn from the Survey of Consumer Finances (CFS) 1989. The analysis reveals that single women are relatively more risk averse than single men or married couples. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2358344Some studies concluded that since women earn less compare to men, they have lower wealth accumulation and hence lower investment and saving rates [Blau & Kahn (2000), Moore & Shier holz (2004), O\u201fNeill (2 003)]. In India there are very few studies which have presented these gender gaps. Madhusoodanan (1997 ) suggested that risk tolerance serves as an illusion of control and thus overconfidence. Somasundaram (1998) concluded th at the investors of Coimbatore prefer the bank and chit fund deposits to save. Mutual funds are the least preferred instrument for inve stment. Rajarajan (2003) and Shobhana and Jayalaxmi (2005) bought out the fact that there is a strong ass ociation between the de mographi c factors and the risk tolerance of the investors. Sharma and Sharma (2004) pointed out that the retail investment activity in India is very low. However the young generation of Jammu holds a positive attitude towards the stock market with moderate belief. Rajarajen (2010) revealed that the population of Indian investors have increased in the recent years. Similarly , the surveys organised by government bodies such as NCAER, RBI Su rvey talk about the individual investor \u201fs investment and saving beha viour. In the same line, Hira and Mugenda (2000) state that an advisor needs to understand the factors that underlie a client\u201fs financial behaviours before they can effectively advise them, and numerous studies have shown that men and women think and behav e differently when it comes to managing money . However there exist some studies exist which denies the existen ce of any gender gap . For example Schubert et al. (1999) find no influence of gender on financial decisions. Masters and Meier (1988) found no dif ference in the risk taking propensity of male and female entrepreneurs. Research Methodology: Formu lation of Hypotheses : Hypotheses are formulated considering \u201e no difference\u2019 exists in the investment behaviour among Male and Female investors. Ho: There w ill be no difference between male and female household s with regard to: \uf0b7 The preferred investment alternative \uf0b7 The amount allocated to investments \uf0b7 The time horizon for investments \uf0b7 The relative risk aversion \uf0b7 The risk tolerance \uf0b7 The perception of risk \uf0b7 The leve l of confidence Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2358344\uf0b7 The use of windfall income \uf0b7 The portfolio diversification strategy \uf0b7 The importance of expert\u2019s advice \uf0b7 The factors influencing the investment in capital market Sample: The data set used in this study is the 2011 Survey of National Council of A pplied Economic Research, titled \u201cHow Household Invest: Evidence from NCAER Household Survey\u201d sponsored by Securities Exchange Board o India (SEBI). The household is the basic unit of analysis in the study. The survey was conducted in 52 major states/ Uni on Territories of India. The sample size is 38,412. Chi square test is used for an alyze the formulated hypotheses with the help of SPSS 21.0 package. Data Analysis : Table 1 represents the summarised data which is given in NCAER survey report. However we h ave summarized the data as per our requirement s. We have worked on the following 11 parameters: Parameter 1: Investment Preference : - As per the survey, assuming a level of risk aversion and information asymmetry, investment preference shows how a rupee of surplus income has been allocated across various investment options by the households. We find that mutual funds constitute the single largest allocation by male(40.75%) and female (41.63%) compared to all other options. Since mutual funds provide returns that are in general greater than market returns and expose investing households to risks that are lower than the market risks, Both male and female households prefer this medium over retail investing. Retail investing is \"costlier\" in terms of time and in formation as well as the variability of returns.",

        "content": "This explains why a mere 21.38 percent (male) and 19.23 percent (female) of all households prefer to invest in the secondary market. Other choices such as derivatives and bonds are even less preferred by mal e investors . However it is noticeable that female investors are more interested in derivatives. Parameter 2: Level of Investment: - Report shows that men and women invest almost same amount. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2358344Parameter 3: Time Horizon : - This shows the relationship between g ender and time horizon for investment. It is interesting to know that women are involved in more speculative behaviour when compared to men. Parameter 4: Relative Risk Aversion: - The relative risk aversion (risk tolerance) of a household has been captured using a risk scale, which can be defined as; ,1,0......4,3,2,1 \uf0ae\uf0ae\uf03d\uf03d iiii i rrN iTARAr where ri is the proportion of risky assets, RAi is asset holdings with some degree of risk, Tai is total asset holdings, i is the household. The risk scale reflects the proportion of risky assets in an investor's portfolio. The numerator of this ratio is the value of investments in risky assets and the denominator is the total value of financial wealth. The risk scale is bounded between 0 and 1. We divide the risk scale into four cate gories, viz., less than equal to 0.25, greater than 0.25 but less than equal to 0.50, greater than 0.50 but less than equal to 0.75 and, greater than 0.75. The degrees of the risk tolerance scale are in increasing order from 0 to 1. The study shows that mo st of the investors are risk averse. Here also, women involve in less risky behaviour. Parameter:5: Risk Tolerance: - The self -perception of households with respect to their willingness to take risk is examined using the following neutral statement: Which o f the following statements is true for you? Willingness to take substantial financial risks/ Willingness to take above -average financial risks, expecting to get above average financial returns/ Willingness to take average financial risks, expecting to get average financial returns/ Not willing to take any financial risks. The findings are consistent with the findings of Parameter 4 i.e. majority of investors either men or women are low risk taker. Parameter 6: Confidence Level: - NCAER used the following vig nette to judge the level of confidence: \"You have saved money for a \"world tour\" that you were looking forward to for a long time. A month before you plan to leave, you lose your job. You would: [Very low level of confidence=Cancel the trip; Low level of c onfidence=Take a shorter vacation; High level of Confidence=Go as scheduled, reasoning that you will use that time to prepare for a job Reflects that household is risk averse Reflects that household is risk averse Reflects that household tolerate risk Reflects that household is risk averse Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2358344search; Very High level of Confidence=Extend your vacation, because this might be your only chance for such a trip]\". The responses are not in the line of previous studies which say that women are less confident. Table1 shows the less confident behaviour of men. Parameter7: Use of Windfall Income :- Windfall gains are unexpected increase in income. One would expect such unex pected income to be used for relatively risky ventures. The following vignette is used to know the behaviour of households: \"If you unexpectedly receive ` 50,000, what would you do? [Saving Only =Deposit it in a bank account; Invest in risk free securities =Invest in high -quality govt. bonds; Invest in securities having moderate risk=Invest in mutual funds; Invest in securities having high risk=Invest in stocks; No saving or investment =Spend it]\". Responses shows men and women show the same attitude towards the use of windfall income and prefer to save it. Parameter 8: Definition of risk: - This was the simply asked question the option mentioned in table 1 under parameter 8. Investors take it as the uncertainty of returns. Parameter 9: Portfolio Diversificati on:- This parameter discussed the portfolio diversification strategy adopted by me and women. Table 1 show that women consist more risky securities in their portfolio.",

        "content": "Parameter 10: Expert Advice : - Basically this parameter shows the herd behaviour of investors. The following vignette is used to know the herd behaviour of households: \"Some experts are predicting that the prices of assets such as gold, jewels, collectibles, and real estate (hard assets) will increase in value; bond prices may fall. However, experts have advised you that government bonds are relatively safe. Most of your investments are currently in high -interest government bonds. What would you do? [Truther=Hold the bonds; Liberal=Sell the bonds, put half the proceeds into the stock market, a nd the other half into assets such as land; Free Thinker=Sell the bonds and put all the money into buying land and precious metals; Contrarian=Sell the bonds and put all the money into buying assets like land and borrow additional money to buy more assets such as land]\" The study shows that when it comes to follow the advice of experts, both male and female shows the little bit influence of expert\u201fs advice. Parameter 11: Factor s influencing the investment in the stock market: - As per the NCAER survey report , women invest less in stock market because of their resource constraints whereas men invest less because they don\u201ft know about the investment options.

Table 2 shows that p \u2013 value is higher than the level of significant for all the parameters i.e. p> 0.0 5, hence all the null hypotheses are accepted. This means there is no significance difference among the male and female households with regard to the preferred investment alternative, the amount allocated to investments, the time horizon for investments, t he relative risk aversion, the risk tolerance, the perception of risk, the level of confidence, the use of windfall income, the portfolio diversification strategy, the importance of expert\u201fs advice and the factors influencing the investment in capital mark et.",

Now she is playing a role of not only a homemaker, but also dea ling with high valued decisions including financial decisions at par with men. The above discussion shows that the decisi ons taken by the women are not different from the decisions taken by men. This result is however not in the line of previous studies which say that the financial behaviour of men and women have a significant difference . The reason may be the recent financi al turmoil due to which a significant change has occurred in the investment activities of both men and women. Refer ences: 1. Agnew, J.

As trend -following strategies make money from outlier trades with long holding periods, changing the average holding period based on hypothetical rebalancing results in a higher effective win rate than what is measured by the fraction of winning trades. 1. Introduction Trend -following strategies, also referred to as divergent strategies, tend to have a lower win rate but higher payoff ratio, as compared to higher frequency trading strategies, including those that are referred to as convergent, which usually have a high win rate but a lower payoff ratio. The win rate is defined as the percentage of winning trades. Typical win rates of a trend -following strategy are in the range of 20% to 40%, and usually lower than 50%. The reason that trend -following strategies are highly profitable is that they realize a high payoff ratio, which is the ratio of the average winning trade to the average losing trade. This ratio is usually much larger than 1, and values ca n vary between 2 and 10, or even higher. In the case of convergent strategies, the win rate is usually higher than 50%, and in some cases above 70%, but the payoff ratio is lower, and usually less than 1. The profitability of a trading strategy is a functio n of the win rate and payoff ratio. If we define a profitable strategy as one that has a profit factor greater than 1, or a ratio of the sum of winning trades divided by the absolute value of the sum of losing trades greater than 1, then the following hold s: where PF is the profit factor, R is the payoff ratio, and w is the win fraction . This relationship is universal and holds for all trading strategies regardless of frequency or timeframe [1]. Note that the low threshold for profitability is when the p rofit factor is set to 1, and in that case, the minimum payoff ratio is calculated from equation 1 as follows: 2. Win Rate as a Function of Holding Periods We define T W and T L as the average holding periods of winning and losing trades. Under the reasonable assumption of a random walk, the following hold [2]: Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=43721512 where G and L are the average win and average loss, respectively. Combining e quations 3 and 4 yields: and after combining equation 1, after setting PF=1, and equation 5, we obtain: Equation 6 offers an approximation for the win rate w, as a function of the holding times for winning and losing trades, Tw and T L, respectively. 2. An Alternative Way of Measuring Trend -following Win Rates Since trend -following strategies \"cut losses short and let winners run,\" the holding times for winners are much longer than those of the losers and also larger than the comparable measures of higher frequency strategies. For trades that last long, we can assume closing and reopening them to transform them into a series of winners. We can assume that the win rate will be \" adjusted \" once a day, once a week, or once a month, depending on how long the trade is held. For example, if the average holding period for winners T W is 252 days, or one trading year, we can imagine 12 trades with a holding period of 21 days each. Equation 6 is used to figure out the strategy's win rate, and we assu me that losing trades will be held for 32 days on average . The result is 0.263, or 26.3%. We can calculate the effective win rate for monthly adjustments by dividing T W by 12. After using equation 6, we obtain 0.552, or 55.2%, for the effective win rate. Since the effective win rate depends on the adjustment period, the upper bound for the daily timeframe is when the frequency is daily, and the result is 0.85, or 85% for this particular example.",

Conclusion It may make no sense to compare the fraction of winners of a trend -following strategy to a short -term one. Low win rates give the impression that trend -following strategies are not as successful as those short -term ones with high win rates, but this is an ar tifact of long holding periods. By adjusting the holding period of winners, an effective win rate for trend -following strategies can be calculated, and the equation for that purpose was developed. The effective win rate offers a more realistic measure of t he success rate of trend -following strategies as opposed to the traditional measure based on the fraction of winners. References 1.

Besides asset class-specific risks, growth and inflation risks are amongst a few economic risk drivers that crucially drive investment portfo- lio performances, and a prudent multi-asset investor would look to navigate such risks across asset classes through a diversified portfolio. Such an approach rests on a long investment horizon, which eventually will see alternative investment philosophies or styles performing better over shorter horizons. However, the underlying risk premia are rewarded through- out different economic environments, and, therefore, portfolios targeting such cross-sectional risks come with more balanced risk-return profiles and are expected to be more resilient. One way to harvest the long-term risk premia across asset classes and exploit their medium-term cyclicality is to dynamically allocate to specific risk premia based on macroe- conomic indicators, e.g., gross domestic product (GDP), consumer price index (CPI), un- employment rates, default-, or term spreads. Such indicators are deemed relevant not only theoretically but also empirically for explaining time-variation in asset class returns (e.g., Chen, Roll, and Ross, 1986, Estrella and Hardouvelis, 1991, Gilchrist and Zakraj\u0161ek, 2012, or Boons, 2016), but less so for explaining the variation of asset class specific style factor returns (Ilmanen, Israel, Moskowitz, Thapar, and Lee, 2021, Baltussen, Swinkels, and Van Vliet, 2021, or Baltussen, Swinkels, Vliet, and Vliet, 2023). It is thus a challenge to conceive a multi-asset portfolio allocation that allows investors to diversify across salient macro risk factors while simultaneously exploiting time variation in asset class as well as style factor returns. Alternatively, the literature analyzes key drivers of asset class and style factor returns by decomposing the given investment universe via statistical techniques (e.g., Greenberg, Babu, and Ang, 2016 or Bass, Gladstone, and Ang, 2017).",

In this paper, we emphasize the use of such macro factors for portfolio construction and analyze the robustness of diversified macro factor investing throughout different economic cycles over a 100-year sample period. For augmenting such diversified macro allocation, we investigate a dynamic approach that accounts for the impact of these cycles on the performance of different asset classes and style factors. To this end, we develop specific macro factor views that result in macro factor weights based on the identified economic cycle. These macro factor views can readily be transferred into tactical allocation decisions at the asset class or style factor level, and we demonstrate how these signals can be exploited in a Black-Litterman framework. Our work is related to Amato and Lohre (2020), who analyze macro factor investing based on a broad set of asset classes as well as to Swade et al. (2021) who extend the investment universe to also include the corresponding style factors. However, these works focus on rather short samples, leaving the authors with only few macroeconomic regimes to navigate. In contrast, our study enjoys a considerably increased sample period of 100 years, allowing us to evaluate macro factor investing over multiple economic cycles. Specifically, we construct a dynamic macro factor allocation strategy in the spirit of Scherer and Apel (2020) but we operationalize macro factor views in a Black-Litterman framework. Additionally, we augment this macro-sensitive strategy by individual asset class and style factor views such as time-series factor momentum (Gupta and Kelly, 2019). We contribute to the literature in several ways. First, we extend the macro factor invest- ingevidenceby constructingandanalyzingmulti-assetmulti-factorportfoliosover a100-year period.

Specifically, we can account for different economic regimes and analyze their impact on the robustness of the constructed portfolios. Second, we adapt models used in the business cycle literature to pair the construction pro- cess of macro factor portfolios with identified macroeconomic cycles. The resulting dynamic 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060macro factor allocation enables capturing the cyclicality of macro factors, asset classes, and style factors alike while mitigating salient macroeconomic risks. Third, we incorporate these macro factor views in a classic Black-Litterman framework by transforming them into in- vestable style factor and asset class views. The resulting setup can readily be augmented by further individual style factor views, offering a highly versatile strategic and tactical macro allocation framework. Our results confirm the medium-term cyclicality of macro-based portfolios and their sensitivity to different economic regimes and periods of distress. We build diversified macro factor mimicking portfolios that retain the genuine macro characteristic but prove to be more robust over the last century than the underlying macroeconomic factor by virtue of diversification effects. Exploiting their time variation a tactical allocation overlay yields an information ratio of 0.49 out-of-sample compared to a diversified macro factor risk parity portfolio. Combining the latter with time-series momentum signals increases the information ratio to 1.73. The outperformance varies across specific economic regimes, with recovery periods benefiting the most. Please note however that the primary objective of this paper is to present a framework for macro-sensitive multi-asset multi-factor allocation. Our empirical results serve to illustrate the potential of such an approach, but do not aim to represent directly replicable real-life investment strategies. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews factor modeling and investing as well as the challenges associated with investing through different economic cycles. It also explains how to back out macro factor-mimicking portfolio weights based on the orthogonalization technique of Meucci, Santangelo, and Deguest (2015).",

The resulting portfolios are complemented 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060by predictive style factor and asset class tilts. Section 5 concludes. 2 Macro factors and mimicking portfolios 2.1 Reviewing macro and style factor research Ever since the introduction of the seminal capital asset pricing model (CAPM)1and Ross\u2019s (1976) arbitrage pricing theory (APT), a variety of factor models have been put forward to explain asset returns. Although these models differ in the choice of explanatory factors, they all follow the same intuition. For instance, under APT, the returns R\u2208RN\u00d71ofNrisky assets follow a factor intensity structure expressed as: R=B\u00b7F+\u03b5, (1) where F\u2208RK\u00d71represents the returns of Ksystematic factors with respective factor loadings B\u2208RN\u00d7Kand asset-specific idiosyncratic risks \u03b5\u2208RN\u00d71, which are assumed to be uncorrelated across assets and factors and have zero mean. Following APT, many different factor models have been developed to determine asset prices (see, for example, Fama and French (1993, 2015); or Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) in the realm of equity factor models). Most factor models deal with asset-specific factors, i.e., factors that are constructed by sorting on asset class-specific characteristics. Notwith- standing, various studies have shown macroeconomic variables to be relevant in explaining individual asset prices and even emphasized that asset prices are not only sensitive to eco- nomic news but also find the related risks being priced, see, e.g., Chen, Roll, and Ross (1986), Fama and French (1989), Pontiff and Schall (1998), or Ilmanen, Maloney, and Ross (2014). Macroeconomic variables, such as industrial production, inflation shocks, or more financial market-related ones like the term spread, have not only been tested for their effect on as- 1See Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Mossin (1966) and Treynor (1961). 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060set class returns but also on individual style factors. For example, Chordia and Shivakumar (2002) suggest that profits of momentum strategies can be explained by a set of lagged macro variables, and adjusting for such variables significantly curbs momentum profits. In a similar vein, Cooper, Mitrache, and Priestley (2022) as well as Kirby (2019) doc- ument significant explanatory power of macroeconomic variables for value and momentum factors. They highlight the time-dependency of different style factor returns with respect to macroeconomic regimes and structural breaks. Yet, although Ilmanen et al. (2021) confirm this significant time variation in risk-adjusted style factor returns over a century of historic data, they deem them hard to forecast based on macroeconomic variables. This is in line with Baltussen, Swinkels, and Van Vliet (2021) who also do not find significant explanatory power of macro variables to forecast style factors using a spanning analysis covering about two centuries. These seemingly contradictory findings might be rationalized through structural breaks thatseparatedifferenteconomicregimes. Specificstylefactorsmightcomewithdifferentiated performancepatternsforindividualregimesbutseemfairlyunaffectedbymacrochangesover thewholesampleperiod. Inthiscontext, AngandBekaert(2004)proposearegime-switching model characterizing different market regimes in terms of expected returns and conditional volatility. They emphasize the strong performance of regime-shifting investment strategies compared to static allocations. Such evidence is substantiated by various researchers in the context of factor timing strategies based on different regime classifications (see, e.g., Polk, Haghbin, and De Longis, 2020; Chousakos and Giamouridis, 2020). To this end, Markov- switching models are frequently used, see, e.g., Kritzman, Page, and Turkington (2012) who forecast regimes in market turbulence, inflation, and economic growth. An alternative approach for navigating different regimes has been put forward by Jurczenko and Teiletche (2018). They propose an alternative to the framework of Black and Litterman (1991, 1992) and ultimately use views generated by macroeconomic regime signals to construct a linear combination of a passive risk-based portfolio and a mean-variance optimized portfolio. 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060Another strand of the style factor timing literature deals with slower-moving models based on economic regimes. These models typically come with fewer changes between the different regimes, i.e., the necessary criteria to pinpoint a regime switch are more restrictive.",

All these papers document significant exposure of some style factor strategies to different economic regimes, which at the very least suggests some room for profitable timing of style factors. 2.2 Constructing macro factor-mimicking portfolios Macro factors directly follow the factor representation in equation (1) and the implications of APT; however, there is no preferred macro factor model which leaves a few choices to the researcher. Besides the choice of factors, there is an important challenge in dealing with macro factors instead of asset class-specific style factors: Macro factors lack direct investability. Whilst style factors are usually represented by long-short portfolios created from an investable universe, macro factors call for mapping them to tradable instruments. Therefore, investors typically resort to mimicking portfolios that consist of tradable assets but have similar properties as the given macro factor. Addressing the said challenges of macro factor investing we resort to a specific set of macro factors. Ideally, the chosen macro factor representation would consist of uncorrelated factors to speed the construction of diversified macro factor portfolios (Swade et al., 2021). Given that macroeconomic factors need to be mimicked by investable assets anyways, one mightaswellresorttoorthogonalfactorversionsinsteadassuggestedbyMeucci, Santangelo, and Deguest (2015).

A key component is the minimum torsion matrix torthto transform the original factors into uncorrelated ones such that Forth=torthF. We follow Meucci, Santangelo, and Deguest (2015) and choose the minimum torsion matrix torth, which minimizes the tracking error to the original factors as: torth= arg min Cor(tF)=IdKvuut1 KKX k=1Var\u0012(tF)k\u2212Fk \u03c3F k\u0013 , (3) where t\u2208RK\u00d7K,IdKrepresents the K-dimensional identity matrix, and \u03c3F k\u2208Rdenotes the volatility of factor Fk.

(2021) for more details on the construction and attributes of orthogonal factors. 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=46990603 A century of macro factor investing 3.1 Data In implementing a macro factor-based investment approach, we work with a global set of assets, style factors, and macro factors. Our sample is based on Baltussen, Swinkels, and Van Vliet (2021) and considers 104 years of monthly data from 31 January 1918 through 31 December2021. Thedatasetisconstructedusingfinancialmarketpricesandmacroeconomic series from Bloomberg, Datastream, and the OECD. These series are combined with data from Global Financial Data as well as monthly commodity future data from Chicago Board of Trade annual reports.3All returns are in excess of local risk-free rates and expressed in U.S. dollars. Our final set of investable assets features one global index instrument for each of the three asset classes equities, bonds, and commodities as well as four style factors within each of these asset classes and within currencies. The four style factors are betting against beta (BAB), carry, momentum, and value. These style factors are defined as follows: Carry is defined as the implied yield on each instrument, i.e., futures implied excess dividend yield for equities, the interest rate differential for currencies, excess bond yield plus rolling curve for bonds, and futures implied convenience yield for commodities. Value is the dividend yield for equities, the real yield for bonds, a five-year reversal in spot prices for commodities, and absolute and relative purchasing power parity for currencies. Momentum is the 12-month\u20131- month excess return. BAB is defined as low beta assets minus high beta assets with positions neutralized for the ex-ante beta, where beta is measured relative to the global asset class portfolio.

The equity style factors exhibit annualized returns ranging from 2.17% (Value) to 7.11% (Momentum) with volatilities around 10.30%. As for fixed income, the utilized global bond index yields 5.06% return at 3.94% volatility, and the corresponding four style factors show annualized returns ranging from 0.76% (BAB) to 6.50% (Carry) and come at 8.16% (BAB) to 11.35% (Carry) volatility. Commodities are the most volatile asset (18.57%) and have an annualized return of 2.69%. The corresponding style factors have returns between 1.27% (BAB) and 5.70% (Momentum). Lastly, we consider four currency factors with annual returns ranging from 0.32% (Value) to 3.35% (Carry). Overall, 15 out of these 20 style factor strategies have Sharpe ratios significantly greater than zero as indicated by their t-statistics in Table 1. [Table 1 about here.] Next, we turn to the choice of macro factors. Ideally, macro factors are representative of investors\u2019 concerns and exogenous shocks across regions and asset classes. Specifically, we choose a parsimonious set of three macro factors to describe, model, and navigate distinct economic regimes. The three factors are Growth, Inflation, and Defensive. Growth and Inflation directly address investors\u2019 core concerns about expected future cash flows. Whilst the growth factor determines future cash flows, inflation crucially impacts their present value. The third factor, Defensive, is expected to do well when the other two factors perform poorly. Swade et al. (2021) rationalize this choice of macro factors by statistical clustering of a broad multi-asset multi-factor universe. Similar to Lohre, Hixon, et al. (2020), they build corresponding macro factor-mimicking portfolios to investigate their efficacy in macro factor completion strategies. Before constructing diversified and robust mimicking portfolios for these three macro factors, we need to select relevant time series proxies for these three macro dimensions. Specifically, we choose representative global indices as approximations of the genuine macro factors, i.e., global equities (Growth), commodities (Inflation) as well as global treasuries (Defensive). Next, we mimic these proxies using the whole set of asset classes and style 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060factors to create highly diversified macro factor portfolios. Of course, the choice of macro factors and their representative proxy can be altered based on investor preference without anylossofgeneralityofourproposedmacrofactorinvestingframework. Forinstance, anaive approach would simply define the three said asset class indices as macro factor portfolios. However, one would thus forego the key virtue of the proposed MFMP construction which is to bring diversification within and across the various MFMPs. Ourchoiceisinlinewithalternativesthatlooktoidentifythemostdominantcomponents of asset return variation in a given portfolio (see, for example, Bass, Gladstone, and Ang, 2017). While the authors end up using seven macro factors that account for over 95% of the comovement of asset class returns, our choice of macro factors resonates with their first three principal components that account for 85% of the cross-asset movements. However, instead of resorting to such statistical factors, we choose macro factors close to investable assets by characterizing macro factors as proxies of global asset baskets. As a consequence, we give up some statistical relevance but we benefit from an increase in economic relevance and robustness of the resulting MFMPs. 3.2 Constructing robust MFMPs Given the set of macro factors and investable assets, we aim to construct robust portfolios clearly mimicking the orthogonalized macro factors throughout various economic cycles. We calculatetheseMFMPsasstatedinEquation(4).

ThedefensiveandinflationMFMPsfaithfullymimictheirunderlyingfactor, exhibiting almost pure factor risk exposures to the targeted macro factor. While the growth MFMP exhibits some non-growth macro factor exposure in the early sample, it is also meaningfully tracking growth risk through time. Lastly, we turn to the diversified risk parity strategy along the three MFMPs, labeled MFRP portfolio (last row).5Despite constraints, this portfolio maintains equal risk contributions of all underlying macro factors over time. Also, the corresponding asset weights are fairly stable over time without unduly high turnover or leverage. [Figure 1 about here.] 3.3 MFMPs through the cycles We next explore the MFMPs\u2019 sensitivity to different macroeconomic market cycles and we leverage 100 years of data covering multiple economic and market regimes, including several bear markets and recessions. To classify market states as regimes, we consider the following approaches. First, we differentiate between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 market states as characterized by positive or negative global equity returns. Specifically, bull and bear market periods are classified based on calendar year returns of the global equity return series, and we thus pin- point 22 bear and 78 bull market years in the out-of-sample period. Second, we determine recessionary versus expansionary periods. A given calendar year is classified as recessionary when it is considered recessionary at least six months by the NBER; otherwise, it is clas- sified as expansionary. The out-of-sample period has 15 recessionary and 85 expansionary years. Lastly, we analyze the MFMPs\u2019 performance in distinct growth-inflation regimes. 5Early applications of diversified risk parity strategies based on PCA-based factor portfolios can be found in Lohre, Opfer, and Orsz\u00e1g (2014) for multi-asset investing and in Lohre, Neugebauer, and Zimmer (2012) for equity portfolios selection. 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060Specifically, we divide the out-of-sample period into four regimes, based on the annual re- turn of the simple growth factor and end-of-year realized inflation. The resulting regimes are characterized by positive (negative) annual growth returns in combination with positive (negative) inflation. Our out-of-sample data comprises 6 (2) years of positive (negative) growth and negative inflation as well as 72 (20) years with positive (negative) growth and positive inflation. Table 2 highlights the performance of the three original macro factors (Panel A) as well as the orthogonal MFMPs and the diversified risk parity portfolio (MFRP, Panel B). The full sample statistics (first column) illustrate that the growth factor as well as its associated MFMP are the most profitable in terms of absolute returns, yielding annualized historical returns of 10.69% and 19.88%, respectively, followed by the defensive factor with 5.08% and 13.25%, respectively.",

        "content": "On a risk-adjusted basis, the latter MFMP is most appealing with a Sharpe ratio of 1.56 compared to 0.98 for the growth MFMP. The inflation MFMP has an annualized return of 10.34% and a Sharpe ratio of 0.37. [Table 2 about here.] Focusing on the different \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 states, we clearly see the risks associated with investing in risky assets. Whilst the growth MFMP has extraordinary annualized returns in positive regimes like bull markets (27.93% ) or expansionary regimes (23.93%), its performance lags in \u2018bad\u2019 states (-8.65%) or recessionary periods (-3.06%). The most robust MFMP is the defensive one, which has the highest Sharpe ratios throughout bear versus bull markets (1.61 vs 1.39) as well as recessionary versus expansionary regimes (1.87 vs 1.49). These observations also hold across the four distinct growth/inflation regimes. Here, the defensive MFMP has the highest Sharpe ratios for the majority of considered macro regimes, i.e., positivegrowthpairedwithnegativeinflation(1.65for6years)ornegativegrowthpaired withpositive(1.49for20years)ornegativeinflation(0.38for2years), respectively. However, the growth MFMP performs best with a Sharpe ratio of 1.66 in positive growth and inflation 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060regimes which was the prevailing regime (72 years) in our sample period. The inflation MFMP performs best in the positive growth and inflation regime (0.58) but still lags behind the other two portfolios. Overall, we see diversification taking effect, with all MFMPs experiencing larger risk- adjusted performance than the original factors. Yet, we still observe relevant mimicking properties, and the MFMPs\u2019 behavior is consistent with that of the original macro factors in specific regimes. Naturally, the single portfolios perform best in their targeted regime, but the single MFMPs are more robust across various macroeconomic states. Maximizing diversification, we next build the MFRP portfolio across the three individual MFMPs. The diversified MFRP portfolio benefits from macro diversification effects curbing the downside associated with poor macroeconomic conditions while only giving up a small portion of the upside. Importantly, the MFRP portfolio has the highest Sharpe ratios for the majorityofconsideredmacroregimes,i.e.,bullmarkets(1.74),expansionaryperiods(1.56)as well as positive growth/inflation regimes (1.77). Still, the MFRP lacks the defensive MFMP in a few periods, e.g., bear markets (0.29 vs. 1.39) or recessionary periods (0.59 vs. 1.87). Naturally, this suggests room for improving portfolio performance through dynamic portfolio allocation which we investigate subsequently. 4 Dynamic macro factor investing 4.1 Combining macro and style factor views via Black-Litterman The previous section suggests that a dynamic macro factor allocation correctly anticipating macro factor cyclicality can outperform the diversified MFRP portfolio. To this end, we investigate tactical allocation signals by complementing strategic portfolio allocations in the Black-Litterman (BL) (1991, 1992) framework. In particular, we generate macro factor views aswellasassetclassandstylefactorviewstorefinetheexpectedreturnsinthemean-variance optimization (7). Using the standard master BL formula for refining return and covariance 14 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060estimates, the return inputs result from: \u00b5BL=\u0002 (\u03c4\u03a3)\u22121+PT\u2126\u22121P\u0003\u22121\u0002 (\u03c4\u03a3)\u22121\u03a0+PT\u2126\u22121Q\u0003 , (8) with\u03a3referring to the variance-covariance matrix of all assets and style factors as well as \u03c4\u2208Rbeing a scaling constant. \u2126\u2208RL\u00d7Lrepresents the view uncertainty by a diagonal covariance matrix of error terms from the expressed views. P\u2208RL\u00d7Nidentifies the asset classes and style factors subject to views, i.e., it is a projection matrix loading on affected asset classes and style factors. The equilibrium views are given by matrix \u03a0\u2208RN\u00d71and are extracted from the strategic benchmark (bm) allocation: \u03a0=\u03b3\u03a3wbm. In our case, wbmcorresponds to the portfolio weights of the MFRP allocation. The timing signals are collected in the vector Q\u2208RL\u00d71. In our empirical application, we follow Dichtl, Drobetz, Lohre, and Rother (2021) and use a prudent specification of \u2126and\u03c4such that \u2126=diag(\u03a3), \u03c4= 0.015. The variance-covariance matrix in equation (7) is also adjusted according to the classic Black-Litterman formula: \u03a3BL=\u03a3+\u0002 (\u03c4\u03a3)\u22121+P\u22ba\u2126\u22121P\u0003\u22121(9) 4.2 Macro factor views In order to time the three macro factor portfolios, we consider a business cycle model to identify changes in the macroeconomic environment. Business cycle models are used to forecast the global economic environment by combining various macroeconomic indicators. There is extensive literature about different models and variable choices, and we adapt the approaches of Van Vliet and Blitz (2011) and Scherer and Apel (2020) to our needs. Specifically, we build an aggregated indicator of multiple individual macroeconomic variables to classify the economic state.",

Whilst we invest in global assets and factors, we focus on U.S. indicators to enable covering our deep sample.6 The nature of the used indicators is threefold. First, we consider two market-based indicators, the price-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 and the AAA\u2013BAA US spread. A high P/E ratio or a small absolute credit spread indicate a growing economy whilst a low P/E ratio or a large absolute credit spread indicate a shrinking one. Second, we use logarithmic changes in production led by 1 month as output related measure. Last, we consider two consumption-related indicators, expected and unexpected inflation, measured as the fitted values and residuals of a full sample regression of inflation data on 12 months of lagged inflation, respectively.7All these macroeconomic timing indicators are standardized. The resulting Z-scores are winsorized at three standard deviations using an expanding window, in line with our portfolio construction methodology. The aggregate macroeconomic timing indicator results as the equal-weighted combination of the Z-scores. Next, we explain how to forecast economic regimes based on the aggregated Z-score. While the state of the economy is captured by the sign of the indicator, the economic trend can be gauged via the sign of the annual change of levels. Combining these two dimensions results in four possible economic regimes which we classify in line with the related litera- ture as Expansion (positive and increasing Z-score), Peak (positive but decreasing Z-score), Recession (negative and decreasing Z-score), as well as Recovery (negative but increasing Z-score). To limit the number of regime switches and related turnover, we either demand two consecutive periods of uniform changes or a significant one-time move that deviates more than one standard deviation from its mean to mark a regime switch. Figure 2 depicts the development of the aggregate Z-score and resulting business cycle classifications for our sample period from January 1924 to May 2021. Shaded areas indicate NBER recession periods. At first glance, the model timely forecasts most of the recession 6Rapach, Strauss, and Zhou (2013) show that U.S. data are also predictive for other developed countries\u2019 stock market returns. 7See Chen, Roll, and Ross (1986) for a detailed description of the production and inflation measures. 16 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060periods and indicates a recovery of a thriving economy otherwise. The model reflects the most extreme shocks during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the early 1980s recession, the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 and 2009, as well as the COVID-19 lockdown in early 2020. These recessionary periods were characterized by extreme stock market turmoil and sell-off. However, the model does not capture all NBER recession periods equally well, especially milder and/or shorter ones. For instance, the recessions of 1960/1961, 1969/1970, and the burst of the dot-com bubble in 2001 went unnoticed by the macroeconomic indicator. [Figure 2 about here.] Overall, the business cycle model classifies most of the 1,157 sample period months as Expansion (567 months), followed by Peak periods (395 months), see Table 3. There are only few periods classified as Recovery (48 months). The average duration of a given regime is 7.85 months, with Expansion periods lasting the longest (9.78 months) and Recovery periods the shortest (3.69 months). In terms of NBER recessions, there is an overlap of 53% to recession periods in our business cycle model. Some 21% of the Peak periods in our model are (later) categorized as an NBER recession, resonating with the slight delay of our market-based indicators compared to the ex-post classification of NBER. [Table 3 about here.] Panel B of Table 3 depicts the transition matrix for the four regimes. Regime classifi- cations are highly persistent, with probabilities of staying in the previous month\u2019s regime ranging from 73% (Recovery), 85% (Recession) to about 90% (Expansion). Conversely, extreme jumps \"skipping\" one regime in the business cycle have a lower single-digit proba- bility, where the highest probability applies to jumping from a recessionary straight into an expansionary period (6%).

        "content": "To this end, we 17 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060define macro factor view portfolios to inform the BL framework. Specifically, a given macro factor view portfolio is designed to navigate the predicted macro regime well. Note that we do not present optimized macro factor view portfolios but rather choose simple, intuitive view portfolio weights, emphasizing that the efficacy of macro factor timing will be crucially dependent on the accuracy of regime forecasts and much less on the specified view portfolio. Specifically, Panel D of Table 3 shows the four macro factor view portfolios for each of the four regimes. In expansions, the macro factor view portfolio is solely invested in the Growth MFMP. In peak regimes, one is also putting a high weight on the Growth MFMP (80%), but also bringing in defensiveness via the Defensive MFMP (20%) is considered prudent. The recessionary view portfolio should be more diversified with the strongest weight on the Defensive MFMP (120%) and a short position in the Inflation MFMP (-100%); the smallest weight is in the Growth MFMP (80%). Lastly, the recovery view portfolio maintains the negative position in the Inflation (-100%) but goes all in w.r.t. the Growth MFMP (200%). Given these macro view portfolio weights we can back out the corresponding asset class and style factor weights using equation (4). In turn, we populate the view vector Qand projection matrix Pfor the macro factor view case based on the predicted regime and thus operationalize a dynamic macro timing allocation. 4.3 Asset class and style factor views In addition to macro factor views, we also look to harvest views at the level of individual asset classes or style factors. To this end, we focus on time-series factor momentum, noting that our framework can be extended to accommodate any other view. Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen (2012) demonstrate timing financial instruments or whole asset classes based on their past performance, given the strong autoregressive structure in the underlying return series. We follow Gupta and Kelly (2019) in constructing a time-series momentum (TSM) strategy to generate asset class and style factor views. The individual TSM return for an 18 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060individual style factor or asset iwith a one-month holding period is given as: fTSM i,j,k,t =si,j,k,t\u22121\u00d7fi,t, where si,j,k,t\u22121=min( max( 1 \u03c3i,t\u22121jX \u03c4=kfi,t\u2212\u03c4\u22121,\u22122) ,2)(10) Equation (10) scales the actual factor return fi,tof factor iat time tby the scaling term si,j,k,t\u22121. That is, the factor is dynamically scaled by the factor\u2019s return standardized by its annualized volatility \u03c3i,j,t\u22121over the formation period jand after an initial exclusion period k. We choose the formation and exclusion periods in line with the literature and focus on the short-term phenomenon of time series momentum, i.e., j= 1andk= 0. The annualized factor volatility \u03c3i,t\u22121is calculated over the previous 36 months. The resulting Z-scores are capped at \u00b12. The combined TSM strategy then combines all individual factor time-series momentum signals into a single long-short portfolio (with formation window jand exclusion window k) as: TSM j,k,t=P i1{si,j,k,t\u22121>0}fTSFM i,j,k,tP i1{si,j,k,t\u22121>0}si,j,k,t\u22121 | {z } TSMlong\u2212P i1{si,j,k,t\u22121\u22640}fTSM i,j,k,tP i1{si,j,k,t\u22121\u22640}si,j,k,t\u22121 | {z } TSMshort(11) Hence, the long and short legs are rescaled to form a unit leverage TSM portfolio. We use the corresponding portfolio return as well as the long and short positions to populate the view vector Qand projection matrix Pof the BL optimization. 4.4 Empirical results Next, we investigate the efficacy of the tactical overlays based on macro factor views as well as asset class and style factor views. Table 4 depicts net performance characteristics of the MFRP anchor portfolio (Panel A), the MFRP portfolio augmented with a tactical overlay based on either a macro signal (Panel B) or a momentum signal (Panel C), as well as a combination of both signals (Panel D) over the full sample period but also over the 19 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060four salient economic regimes. All performance figures account for two-way turnover8and relative performance figures are measured against the MFRP anchor portfolio. [Table 4 about here.] We first analyze the MFRP portfolio. It has an annualized return of 16.04% at 9.17% volatility, resulting in a Sharpe ratio of 1.75 for the out-of-sample period from January 1924 to May 2021.",

        "content": "The risk-adjusted performance peaks in expansionary periods (Sharpe ratio 1.75) and is lowest during recessionary periods (1.30). The performance during Recessions comes with lower return and higher volatility compared to Expansions. The differences in performance across different regimes suggests ample room for tactical allocation decisions to improve performance, cf. Cavaglia, Scott, Blay, and Hixon (2022). Exploring the potential for (macro) factor timing, we first augment the MFRP alloca- tion by macro factor views (Panel B). One can clearly observe an improvement in absolute returns at similar volatility levels for the whole out-of-sample period but also for all indi- vidual regimes. The corresponding Sharpe ratios are improved as well, ranging from 1.41 (Recession) to 2.66 (Recovery). The active overlay comes with active returns of 0.72% for the full period at a tracking error of 1.46, corresponding to an IR of 0.49. The different subperiods yield similar results with the Recovery period being the one where the overlay portfolio deviates the most from its benchmark resulting in a regime-specific information ratio of 1.23. All other periods experience information ratios between 0.25 (Expansion) and 0.79 (Recession). Despite these improvements in performance outcomes, the overall hit ra- tio, i.e., the proportion of outperformance of the overlay compared to its benchmark on a month-to-month basis, is only 48.50% in the full out-of-sample period, suggesting that the outperformance of the tactical allocation overlay is generated in more extreme months rather than uniformly distributed across the sample. Next, we analyze the performance of the tactical allocation overlay based on momentum 8Forsimplicity, weusetradingcostsof10bpsforallsecuritiesandpertradeassuminganefficientexecution via futures or similar vehicles. 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060views. Panel C clearly highlights the strength of the momentum signals which boosts the performance of the MFRP portfolio to 22% annualized returns at a volatility level of 9.27% and thus results in a Sharpe ratio of 2.39. The active performance is 6.06% at a TE of 3.90% relative to the MFRP portfolio, resulting in an information ratio of 1.55. The performance acrossthefourregimescomeswithamuchsmalleramplitude, suggestingthatthemomentum overlay works similarly well across all regimes. Note that the hit ratio of the momentum signal is 64.59% overall, ranging from 63.14% (Expansion) to 70.21% (Recovery). Combining macro and momentum views gives even higher risk-adjusted performance, as one is diversifying two distinct timing signals. The full out-of-sample Sharpe ratio increases to 2.50 whilst volatility stays very similar to that of the MFRP (9.30%). The corresponding information ratio is 1.73 at a tracking error of 4.19%. The combined timing strategy adds value in all regimes, but the outperformance is particularly pronounced in recession and recovery periods. Overall, the timing strategy improves upon the MFRP benchmark 71.17% of the time. All in all, the tactical allocation overlay helps to improve the performance of the MFRP benchmark portfolio. Whilst the momentum signal boosts performance across all regimes, we also find the macro factor signal to help improve performance, especially in recession and recovery periods. As a result, the overall portfolio becomes more robust in periods of economic downswings while missing less upside potential during economic growth periods. 5 Conclusion To navigate different macroeconomic environments we build macro factor-mimicking port- folios, MFMPs, for Growth, Defensive, and Inflation. These MFMPs are natural building blocks to construct a diversified macro factor risk parity strategy that proves resilient across variouseconomicregimesovera100-yearsampleperiod. Moreover, weexplorethepossibility of dynamic macro factor allocation using a Back-Litterman framework. 21 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4699060We generate two distinct sets of signals. First, we build macro factor views based on a simple business cycle model to identify the state of the economy. Second, we construct time series momentum signals for the single asset class and style factor instruments that drive the tested multi-asset multi-factor strategies. Both, macro and momentum, signals prove valuable and complementary in a combined dynamic macro factor allocation. Overall, the presented macro factor investing framework is an effective route to structure multi-asset multi-factor investment process for navigating various economic cycles.

Investor beliefs about future cash \ufb02ows and prices can be inferred from two sources: asset prices and survey data. One common \ufb01nding in the literature is that subjective beliefs recovered from either surveys or asset prices are at odds with RE. For in- stance, Chen, Hansen, and Hansen [2020] \ufb01nd that expectations and probabilities recovered from asset prices deviate from those under the objective belief. This disconnect between investor beliefs and RE is further echoed in the broader literature, where investor expectations from surveys are di\ufb03cult to reconcile with some predictions of standard RE asset pricing models (Adam and Nagel [2022] and references therein). More- over, deviations from predictions of RE vary with investor and asset characteristics (Ghosh, Korteweg, and Xu [2020]) and depend on market frictions, con\ufb01dence in one\u2019s own belief, and investor sophistication (Giglio, Maggiori, Stroebel, and Utkus [2021]). While the relation between deviations from RE and market frictions is largely documented, there is limited evidence in the literature that quanti\ufb01es the magnitude of these deviations that can be attributed to frictions. This paper \ufb01lls this gap. To what extent do investor beliefs actually deviate from RE if trading frictions faced by investors are taken into account? To answer this question, I develop a theoretical framework to identify investor beliefs using survey data jointly with asset prices while allowing for a broad class of trading frictions. In particular, I quantify investor belief distortion as the deviation from RE that is necessary to jointly accommodate asset prices and survey expectations. The proposed belief distortion metric can be economically interpreted as an upperboundonthedi\ufb00erencebetweenthemaximumSharpeRatioaccordingtoinvestorsand the one inferred by the econometrician. The empirical results of this paper underscore the 1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence of market frictions on our understanding of the magnitude of deviations from RE. More speci\ufb01cally, I document that a statistically and economically signi\ufb01cant component of the investor belief distortion, initially estimated assuming frictionless markets, can be attributed to empirically observable transaction costs. Intuitively, market frictions and trading costs, in particular, can introduce a wedge between investor beliefs about assets\u2019 future returns and the objective asset return distribution. For example, leverage constraints may limit the actions of optimistic investors while short selling costs constrain the actions of pessimistic investors. As a result, future returns may not fully re\ufb02ect investor beliefs recovered by the econometrician who assumes frictionless markets, resulting in signi\ufb01cant belief distortion. However, investor beliefs identi\ufb01ed by taking into account trading frictions deviate from RE to a lesser extent. To formally quantify the impact ofsuchfrictionsonthedistortionofinvestorbeliefs, Iusetheproposedframeworktomeasure the deviation from RE for various levels of trading costs. The proposed framework identi\ufb01es investor beliefs that are consistent with both observed survey information and no-arbitrage pricing relations.",

        "content": "To this end, I jointly use two sets of moment conditions: First, investor expectations obtained from various survey data and second, asset pricing relations characterized by the absence of arbitrage opportunities. These no-arbitrage pricing relations are given by the standard Euler equations in frictionless mar- kets and by inequalities in the presence of market frictions. Therefore, a belief is consistent with asset prices if there exists some investor preference model for which the no-arbitrage pricing relations hold. In the empirical analysis, I quantify deviations from the objective belief necessary to simul- taneously (i) match the one-year ahead market return expectations of individual investors, CFOs, and professional forecasters, and (ii) satisfy asset pricing relations for annual returns of equity portfolios formed on various characteristics. My \ufb01ndings can be summarized as follows. In a standard CAPM setting, investor belief distortions are signi\ufb01cant when markets 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979are assumed to be frictionless. The maximum Sharpe Ratio according to the investor can deviate from the one inferred by the econometrician by almost 90%. Incorporating transac- tion costs remarkably lowers these distortions. A 0.5% (1%) annual trading cost results in a 30% (45%) reduction of the deviation from RE necessary to accommodate asset prices and survey expectations that is initially estimated assuming frictionless markets.1 The framework further allows to study belief distortions across di\ufb00erent levels of investor so- phistication. To this end, I compare the market return expectations of professional forecast- ers, individual investors, and CFOs in terms of consistency with prices of portfolios formed on various characteristics. I \ufb01nd that, once asset pricing relations are satis\ufb01ed, the addi- tional deviation from RE necessary to match survey expectations is an order of magnitude smaller for professional forecasters\u2019 expectations compared to those of individual investors and CFOs. This evidence indicates that the expectations of professional forecasters are more in line with asset prices than those of individual investors and CFOs. Moreover, CFOs\u2019 ex- pectations about the aggregate market are not more closely aligned with asset prices than those of individual investors. The empirical results further document substantial heterogeneity across investors in di\ufb00erent segments of the equity market in terms of the magnitude of investor belief distortion that can be attributed to trading costs. 60% of the belief distortion for investors in small stocks estimated assuming frictionless markets can be explained by a 0.5% annual trading cost. The same degree of trading cost explains 36% of the belief distortion when large stocks are considered, 38% for growth and value stocks, 20% for winner stocks, and 14% for loser stocks.2 1For instance, the trading cost faced by investors exclusively due to bid-ask spreads on US equities from 1993 to 2020, estimated as the e\ufb00ective half bid-ask spread using the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s Trade and Quote database, stands at 0.75%, see Appendix A. 2Ghosh, Korteweg, and Xu [2020] report heterogeneity across segments of the equity market in terms of absolute levels of belief distortion, when investor beliefs are inferred solely from asset prices. 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979When comparing costs relative to long and short portfolio positions, I \ufb01nd that the costs associated with the short legs of trades are signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uential in accounting for the deviations from RE obtained assuming frictionless markets. This e\ufb00ect is particularly pro- nounced in the context of small stocks, where over two-thirds of what was initially perceived as a reduction in belief distortion due to symmetric trading costs impacting both legs of trades is, in reality, attributable to the costs incurred on the short positions. Finally, I use the recovered investor beliefs to scrutinize behavioral biases suggested by the literature, especially those related to market anomalies such as the value-growth anomaly. In analyzingtheprobabilitydistributionsofannualreturnsforvalueandgrowthstockportfolios under both objective and subjective beliefs, a distinct pattern emerges. Investors display an excessive pessimism towards value stocks, lending support to the mispricing interpretation commonly associated with the value-growth anomaly, see Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny [1994], Porta, Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny [1997], among others. Speci\ufb01cally, the prob- ability of experiencing a negative net return for value stock portfolio stands at approximately 29% under the objective distribution, compared to a heightened 39% under the identi\ufb01ed investor belief.",

This paper contributes to a large literature investigating the joint role of investor beliefs and preferences in the determination of asset prices. A growing strand of literature exploits sur- vey expectations data to characterize potential inconsistencies between observed asset prices and RE, see Adam and Nagel [2022]. Two main inconsistencies have been documented in this literature. First, most individual investor expectations are procyclical, see Greenwood and Shleifer [2014], whereas RE asset pricing models predict countercyclical expected returns. Second, the sensitivity of investor portfolio share in equity to changes in investor expecta- tions is much lower compared to the predictions of standard RE asset pricing models, see Vissing-Jorgensen [2003] and Giglio, Maggiori, Stroebel, and Utkus [2021], among others. In 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979contrast, Dahlquist and Ibert [2021] \ufb01nd results in line with RE predictions when focusing on expectations of large sophisticated investors and professional forecasters. In particular, they report countercyclicality of market return expectations of large investors and a higher sensitivity of portfolios of such investors to their expectations. Moreover, Giglio, Maggiori, Stroebel, and Utkus [2021] show that the sensitivity of portfolio holdings to expectations increases as investors face lower costs, implying that trading frictions are important in quan- titatively explaining deviations from RE. Overall, the empirical evidence from the literature suggests a strong relation between de- viations of reported expectations from RE and market frictions that investors face when forming their portfolios. I contribute to this literature, by providing a systematic framework for identifying the deviation from the objective belief necessary to accommodate asset pricing relations in the presence of market frictions and to match evidence on investors\u2019 expecta- tions from survey data. The framework directly quanti\ufb01es the impact of trading costs on the distortion of investors\u2019 subjective beliefs. Empirically, I show that deviations from RE are substantially smaller when accounting for trading costs.

Similarly, Ghosh, Julliard, andTaylor[2017]useaninformationtheoretical framework to recover a multiplicative missing component of consumption-based SDF. This paper di\ufb00ers from this literature in two main aspects. First, I obtain asset pricing relations used to identify investor beliefs in the presence of market frictions with the objective of quantifying the impact of trading costs on the deviation of investor beliefs from RE. Second, I identify investor beliefs using both asset prices and survey expectations. Finally, while the main focus of this paper is quantifying the impact of trading costs on the distortion of investor beliefs, the proposed framework can be used to study examples of 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979economic settings with frictions originating from other sources. Di\ufb00erent types of frictions have been proposed in the literature as potential explanation for the discrepancy between the objective distribution of future outcomes and expectations of economic agents reported in surveys. Such examples include economic settings with information rigidity (Mankiw and Reis [2002] and Coibion and Gorodnichenko [2015]), rational inattention caused by informational constraints (Sims [2003]), bounded rationality (Sargent [2001] and Gabaix [2014], among others), and investors\u2019 uncertainty about their own beliefs (Enke and Graeber [2019]). Whenever the no-arbitrage asset pricing implications of such frictional economies can be characterized by constrained mispricings, the framework provided in this paper can be used to study the properties of investor beliefs consistent with survey data and asset prices. 2 Investor Beliefs, Preferences and Trading Frictions This section outlines the fundamental relations between asset prices, risk preferences, and investor beliefs that hold in a market free of arbitrage but inclusive of trading costs. These interrelations, along with investor expectations obtained from survey data, identify investor beliefs that are consistent with both asset prices and survey-derived expectations. Let us consider a two-period economy with a set of nbasis assets. These assets have a price vectorPtat timetand a payo\ufb00 vector Xt+1at timet+ 1. The probability framework is represented as (\u2126,F,P0), where \u2126is the set of possible outcomes, Fis the collection of events, and P0is the objective probability belief governing the random payo\ufb00 vector Xt+1.",

These market frictions are modeled through a positive transaction cost function h(w), withw\u2208Rnrepresenting 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979the portfolio weight. The transaction cost functions obey two properties: h(\u03b1w) =\u03b1h(w) for any\u03b1\u22650andh(w1+w2)\u2264h(w1) +h(w2). This implies that splitting a given portfolio into multiple orders might not reduce costs, and in some cases, it could even increase them. This approach enables the modeling of trading costs that optimal execution strategies cannot eliminate.3Examples of such transaction costs include no-short selling constraints, costly short selling, bid-ask spreads, and proportional transaction costs, among others. 2.1 Trading Frictions and Absence of Arbitrage Given the set of basis assets, the total cost of a tradeable payo\ufb00 x:=X/prime t+1wis de\ufb01ned as \u03c0(x) :=P/prime tw+h(w), (1) whereP/prime twis the price before costs of the payo\ufb00 x. Therefore, \u03c0(x)represents the aggregate cost, encompassing the transaction costs for trading the portfolio w. In an ideal market devoid of frictions, i.e., h= 0, there exists a relationship between asset prices, investor beliefs, and preferences, given by the Euler equation: EPI[Mt+1Xt+1] =Pt, (2) withMt+1denoting the investor\u2019s stochastic discount factor (SDF). This implies that prices are discounted cash \ufb02ows under the investor\u2019s subjective belief. The existence of a strictly positive SDF satisfying equation (2) is characterized by the absence of arbitrage opportuni- ties or by equilibrium conditions under the subjective belief of a utility-maximizing investor. However, whenmarketfrictionsarepresent, therelationshipbetweenassetprices, riskprefer- ences, and investor beliefs is characterized by inequality conditions, as outlined in the works 3The transaction cost functions addressed in this paper do not consider price impact, where one could potentially reduce costs by splitting portfolios. However, they are adequate for examining the trading costs empirically investigated here, such as bid-ask spreads and short selling costs. 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979of Luttmer [1996], Korsaye, Quaini, and Trojani [2019] in the arbitrage pricing framework, and He and Modest [1995] in the context of consumption-based pricing. In markets with frictions, investors use the total cost function \u03c0and assess probabilities under their subjective belief PIto rule out arbitrage opportunities. Arbitrages considered here are de\ufb01ned as free-lunch opportunities, which get arbitrarily close to a positive payo\ufb00 with a non-positive price.4The following proposition characterizes the absence of arbitrage in markets with frictions under the investor subjective belief. Proposition 1. The absence of arbitrage under investor belief PIis equivalent to the exis- tence of a strictly positive SDF Mt+1, ensuring that for any portfolio w\u2208Rn:5 EPI[Mt+1X/prime t+1w]\u2212P/prime tw\u2264h(w). (3) While equation (2) establishes the interrelation between investor belief, preference, and as- set prices in frictionless markets, Proposition 1 suggests this interrelation in markets with trading costs is governed by (3). Alternatively, it posits that mispricing can emerge in economies where transaction costs are non-negligible. Nonetheless, any strategy exploiting such mispricings is rendered unpro\ufb01table due to the associated transaction costs. The \"Limits to Arbitrage\" literature elucidates why asset prices may not always mirror their fundamental values given by discounted cash \ufb02ows. It posits that various frictions, such as institutional constraints and costs of implementation faced by arbitrageurs, inhibit their ability to correct market anomalies caused by less sophisticated investors, see Gromb and Vayanos [2010] for a review of the literature. In a similar vein, Proposition 1 illustrates that in a simple economic setting, the transaction costs borne by investors can result in 4A free-lunch under belief PIentails payo\ufb00 sequences UkandVkwithUk\u2264Vk,lim inf\u03c0(Vk)<0, and Uk\u2192U\u22650, where inequalities are to be considered under belief PI. 5Proposition 1 is an application of Theorem 2.1 of Jouini and Kallal [1995] on the set of the basis assets. 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979systematic mispricings that remain unexploited, as any potential gains are dominated by the transaction costs. 2.2 Investor Beliefs Consistent with Asset Prices and Survey Ex- pectations Asset prices reveal information about both preferences and beliefs of investors.",

        "content": "However, as stated by equation (2) in absence of market frictions and by inequality (3) in presence of frictions, what asset prices reveal is the interaction between investors\u2019 preferences, char- acterized by the SDF Mt+1, and investors\u2019 belief, PI. The intertwining nature of these two components \u2013 investors\u2019 beliefs and preferences \u2013 makes it challenging to discern one without making additional assumptions about the other. Typically, asset pricing literature assumes that investor belief aligns with the objective belief, as per the Rational Expectations hypothesis, and focuses on specifying investor preferences to explain observed asset prices. This approach involves using a parametric family of SDFs as described by: Mt+1:=M(\u03b8,Zt+1), (4) whereZt+1is a vector of variables underlying investor risk preferences, and \u03b8\u2208Rdis the parameter vector for the SDF.6In my analysis, I retain the parametric SDF family as in equation (4), but I allow for a divergence between investor beliefs and RE, yet still consistent with the absence of arbitrage in frictional markets as per Proposition 1. Accordingly, I de\ufb01ne the set of admissible investor beliefs implied by a given SDF model that satis\ufb01es pricing condition (3) in frictional markets as consistent with asset prices in the absence of arbitrage 6For instance, a standard power utility consumption-based SDF is given by M(\u03b8,Zt+1) =\u03b2Z\u2212\u03b3 t+1, where Zt+1=Ct+1/Ctindicates consumption growth and \u03b8= (\u03b2,\u03b3)encapsulates the SDF parameters, including the time discounting parameter \u03b2and the risk aversion parameter \u03b3. 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979opportunities. De\ufb01nition 1 (Investor beliefs consistent with asset prices) .Given an SDF M(\u00b7,Zt+1)and transaction cost h, the set of beliefs consistent with asset prices is de\ufb01ned as Ph:={P:\u2203\u03b8\u2208Rd:EP[M(\u03b8,Zt+1)X/prime t+1w]\u2212P/prime tw\u2264h(w)for allw\u2208Rn}. (5) Under this de\ufb01nition, investor beliefs are probability distributions for which there exists at least one suitable SDF within a parametric family that satis\ufb01es the pricing relations outlined by the absence of arbitrage opportunities in markets with frictions. In particular, in a frictionless market, investor beliefs are probabilities for which the Euler equation (1) holds for a given parametric SDF, as expressed by: Ph=0:={P:\u2203\u03b8\u2208Rd:EP[M(\u03b8,Zt+1)Xt+1] =Pt}. (6) Survey data regarding investor expectations o\ufb00er additional insights into investor beliefs, extending beyond asset prices. These surveys typically query participants at time tabout their expectations for a variable Yt+1, observable at time t+ 1. These expectations can include forecasts of asset returns, volatility, or the likelihood of returns falling below a certain threshold. Given the survey expectation, denoted as E[Yt+1], I de\ufb01ne the set of beliefs consistent with this expectation: De\ufb01nition 2 (Investor beliefs consistent with survey expectations) .The set of beliefs con- sistent with survey expectation E[Yt+1]is PSE:={P:EP[Yt+1] =E[Yt+1]}. (7) The investor beliefs outlined in equation (7) match survey expectations precisely, though these are often aggregate measures and can be prone to measurement errors. To mitigate this, one approach is to allow EP[Yt+1]to fall within a certain range of E[Yt+1], such as a 10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979con\ufb01dence region for the average survey expectation, i.e., EP[Yt+1]\u2208CI(E[Yt+1]), whereCI represents a con\ufb01dence region with a speci\ufb01ed signi\ufb01cance level. The additional information provided by surveys is helpful to further narrow the set of ad- missible investor beliefs identi\ufb01ed from asset prices alone, simply by imposing admissible investor beliefs to be consistent with observable information generated by both asset prices and survey expectations. De\ufb01nition 3 (Investor beliefs consistent with asset prices and survey expectations) .The set of beliefs consistent with both asset prices and survey expectations is de\ufb01ned as PI:=Ph\u2229PSE. (8) Subsequently, I analyze the characteristics of investor beliefs within PI, focusing particularly on the degree to which investor beliefs must diverge from the objective belief to align with both asset prices and survey expectations. 3 Investor Belief Distortion In this section, I present a theoretical framework designed to assess the deviation of investor beliefs from Rational Expectations. This belief distortion is conceptualized as the discrep- ancy between investors\u2019 subjective beliefs and the objective belief, particularly in presence of market frictions. For this purpose, I extend the framework proposed by Chen, Hansen, and Hansen [2020] to account for market frictions. In absence of market frictions, Chen, Hansen, and Hansen [2020] previously quanti\ufb01ed investor belief distortion as the extent of divergence from the objective belief needed to satisfy the pricing condition (2).",

Here,\u03c6denotes a 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979convex function, satisfying \u03c6(1) = 0, implying that the divergence is zero when both beliefs coincide. Examples of \u03c6-divergences include \u03c72, total variation, and entropy divergences, among others. However, I will focus on the \u03c72-divergence due to its economic interpretability as a measure of belief distortion. The \u03c72-divergence of belief PfromP0is given by \u03c72(P,P0) :=EP0[(N\u22121)2]. (9) The following proposition posits that if beliefs PandP0are aligned regarding the risk pro\ufb01le of portfolios, the square root \u03c72-divergence between the two beliefs is an upper bound for the di\ufb00erence between the maximum Sharpe Ratios under the two beliefs.

Inequality (10) is closely related to the well-known Hansen-Jagannathan bound on the max- imum Sharpe Ratio, Hansen and Jagannathan [1991]. When the two beliefs in question are given by the investor belief and the risk-neutral belief, the change of belief, N, is the forward SDF and the square root of the \u03c72-divergence is its volatility. This and the fact that the Sharpe Ratio under the risk-neutral belief is zero result in the Hansen-Jagannathan bound. Inequality (10) gains in informative value as the basis assets span a more extensive set of contingent claims. When the \u03c72(P,P0)value is large, it implies a signi\ufb01cant potential disparity between the Sharpe Ratio as perceived by the investor and the Sharpe Ratio as retrospectively inferred by the econometrician. As discussed in Section 2.2, investor beliefs can be identi\ufb01ed through moment conditions involving both asset prices and survey expectations. Subsequently, I de\ufb01ne investor belief 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979distortion as the minimal divergence from the objective belief necessary to align with both survey expectations and asset prices in markets characterized by frictions. De\ufb01nition 4 (Investor Belief Distortion) .Investor belief distortion is the smallest deviation from the objective belief required for investor beliefs to be consistent with asset prices and survey expectations. Formally, \u03b4:= inf P\u03c72(P,P0)s.t. P\u2208Ph\u2229PSE. (11) Here,\u03b4represents the divergence of the set of investor beliefs from the objective belief. An in\ufb01nite\u03b4implies the nonexistence of any belief consistent with both asset prices and survey expectations. Conversely, a \u03b4of zero indicates that the objective belief aligns with both asset pricing moment conditions and survey expectations, thereby upholding the Rational Expectations hypothesis. Incorporating more transaction costs broadens the set of investor beliefs that accord with asset prices, thus diminishing the necessary deviation from Rational Expectations to align with both asset prices and survey expectations. In the empirical section, the analysis will focus on quantifying the extent to which the required deviation from Rational Expectations diminishes as empirically observable levels of trading costs are incorporated. The following proposition characterizes the metric \u03b4of investor belief distortion through an equivalent dual optimization problem. This formulation is more tractable compared to problem (11) and instrumental in deriving the estimator of the belief distortion \u03b4and its large-sample properties. Proposition 3 (Dual Characterization) .Assuming the regularity condition that for every \u03b8\u2208Rd, there exists a corresponding \u02dcP\u223cP0such thatE\u02dcP[M(\u03b8,Zt+1)X/prime t+1w]\u2212P/prime tw\u2264h(w) 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979for allw\u2208Rn, with strict inequality when h(w)>0, then we can state7,8 \u03b4=\u2212sup \u03b8\u2208Rdinf \u03b3\u2208R,w\u2208Rn,\u03b1\u2208RkEP0[(1\u2212M(\u03b8,Zt+1)X/prime t+1w\u2212Y/prime t+1\u03b1\u2212\u03b3)2 +/4] +P/prime t+1w+h(w) +E[Yt+1]/prime\u03b1+\u03b3.

This proposition characterizes investor belief distortion as the result of a \ufb01nite-dimensional optimization problem, wherein the transaction cost function regularizes the dual parame- terwrelated to assets subject to trading costs. The regularity condition assumption in Proposition 12 is in line with standard interior-point requirements commonly invoked in the characterization of optimality conditions under inequality constraints. Problem (12) can be used to estimate the minimum deviation from RE necessary to accom- modate only asset prices by setting the dual parameter \u03b1to zero, e\ufb00ectively disregarding the survey expectations moment condition. Conversely, setting the dual parameters wto zero enables the evaluation of the minimal deviation from RE needed to conform exclusively to survey expectations.",

The ensuing paragraphs outline the data utilized and the methodology employed for estimating distortions of investor beliefs. 4.1 Data Investor beliefs and preferences are identi\ufb01ed by using moment conditions related to both asset prices and survey expectations. The initial set of moment conditions is based on asset pricing relations, employing portfolios sorted by characteristics from the Kenneth French data library. Speci\ufb01cally, six portfolios sorted by size and book-to-market are utilized to represent a broader range of assets. Additionally, portfolios formed based on size, book-to- market, and momentum are used to represent di\ufb00erent categories of assets - namely, large and small assets, growth and value assets, and winners and losers - to examine the variability in investor belief distortion across equity market segments. The second set of moment conditions for identifying investor beliefs is derived from survey expectations of the one-year ahead market return. The primary source of these expectations is the Livingston survey data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Here, pro- fessional forecasters semiannually provide their expectations of the one-year ahead S&P500 indexprice. Theexpectedmarketreturnisde\ufb01nedas E[RM,t+1] =E/bracketleftBigPM,t+1 PM,t/bracketrightBig +DM,t PM,tE/bracketleftBigDM,t+1 DM,t/bracketrightBig , where the expected price growth, E/bracketleftBigPM,t+1 PM,t/bracketrightBig , from 1992 onwards is determined by the ratio of twelve-month to zero-month mean level forecasts and from 1952 to 1992 by the annualized ratio of twelve-month to six-month forecasts. The expected dividend growth, E/bracketleftBigDM,t+1 DM,t/bracketrightBig , in 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979line with Nagel and Xu [2022], is set at 1.064, the average S&P500 annual dividend growth from 1946 to 2020. The second source of survey expectations is from Nagel and Xu [2022], where the authors aggregate investor expectations of the market return from various sources, including the UBS/Gallup Survey, the Conference Board survey, and the Michigan survey of consumers. This dataset includes quarterly observations of one-year ahead investor expectations from 1990 to 2019. A third source of survey expectations, used in the empirical analysis, is the Graham-Harvey CFO survey. In this survey, participants quarterly provide their expecta- tions of the one-year ahead market return, covering the period from 2000 to 2020. Figure 1 presents the time series of investor expectations of market return from these three sources. 4.2 Methodology The empirical analysis employs mainly the CAPM SDF, de\ufb01ned as Mt+1=a+bRM,t+1with aandbbeing real numbers, and RM,t+1representing the market return. The choice of CAPM is driven by two primary reasons. Firstly, its widespread adoption as a benchmark model in Asset Pricing, owing to its versatility across diverse economic scenarios and distributional assumptions. Secondly, and more crucially, in the context where the investor SDF is given by the CAPM and survey expectations are of the market return, both the SDF variable Zt+1and the expectation variable Yt+1converge on the market return RM,t+1. This implies that survey expectations reveal information not only about investor beliefs but also about investor preferences. We may thus gain a more informative assessment of the investor belief distortion by combining survey expectations of the market return in addition to investor SDF provided by the CAPM. The investigation extends to encompass power and recursive utility-based SDFs related to the market return, which is further elaborated in Section 4.7. Proposition 3 provides a dual framework to estimate investor belief distortion across various 16 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979market frictions. The estimator is formulated as \u02c6\u03b4:=\u2212sup \u03b8inf\u03b3,w,\u03b11 T/summationdisplay t/parenleftBig (1\u2212M(\u03b8,RM,t+1)R/prime t+1w\u2212\u03b1RM,t+1\u2212\u03b3)2 +/4 +\u03c0(R/prime t+1w) +\u03b1E[RM,t+1]/parenrightBig +\u03b3, (14) whereRt+1={Xi,t+1/Pi,t}i=1,...,nis the pre-cost return vector of the basis assets.

A related metric that is used throughout this empirical analysis, alongside \u03b4, is given by the following expression: \u03b4SR:=\u221a \u03b4/SRmax(P0), (15) where\u03b4denotes the minimum \u03c72-divergence, as speci\ufb01ed in equation (11).

Bid-Ask Spreads: In this context, investors bear transaction costs in the form of bid-ask spreads when trading assets. The (half) bid-ask spread is given by /epsilon1bas= (Pask\u2212Pbid)/2P, wherePask,PbidandPareask, bid, andmidprices, respectively. Tosimplifytheterminology, I will use \u2019bid-ask spread\u2019 to refer to what is technically the \u2019half bid-ask spread\u2019. This spread represents the cost incurred by an investor when purchasing a share of an asset at the ask price or selling at the bid price, expressed as a fraction of the asset\u2019s mid price. Thus, the transaction cost for a portfolio wis given by h(w) =/summationdisplay wi\u22650/epsilon1basPiwi\u2212/summationdisplay wi\u22640/epsilon1basPiwi. When translating to returns, the bid-ask spread cost results as /epsilon1bas/bardblw/bardbl1, introducing a LASSO penalty (Tibshirani [1996]) in the optimization equation (12).

Short Selling Costs: Short selling costs include direct costs, such as asset loan fees, or indirect costs, such as limited lending supply of assets and asset recall risk. When borrowing reported values of trading costs can be viewed as aggregated quantities across various types of transaction costs. 18 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979assets, investors need to provide the lender with collateral on which the latter pays a rebate rate. The di\ufb00erence between the risk-free rate and the rebate rate is a direct measure of the loan fee. In this setting, I consider only direct costs faced by investors when short selling assets and the shorting cost is proportionate to the price of the asset, i.e., h(w) =\u2212/summationdisplay wi\u22640/epsilon1ssPiwi,with/epsilon1ss>0.

The scenario where /epsilon1ssis set to in\ufb01nity ( /epsilon1ss=\u221e) equates to a market condition where investors are not able to short sell. The following empirical analysis employs conservative estimates for trading costs of 0.5% and 1%. For context, Appendix A illustrates that the average (half) bid-ask spread alone from 1993 to 2020, as per TAQ data and following the method by Holden and Jacobsen [2014], is 0.75%. When addressing short selling costs and constraints, the literature reports varied \ufb01gures for asset loan fees. For instance, Cohen et al. [2007] note an average fee as high as 2.60% for small stocks. Moreover, the next empirical analysis does not consider other signi\ufb01cant limitations when short selling, such as the limited availability of stocks for borrowing and the risk of stock recalls. As a result, the \ufb01ndings presented in the following sections are based on conservative estimates of trading costs.",

In essence, the analysis seeks to understand how the assumed levels and types of transaction costs impact our understanding of the de- viation of investor beliefs from Rational Expectations. Let us consider investor beliefs identi\ufb01ed by pricing portfolios formed on size and book- to-market ratios, and matching one-year ahead market return expectations of professional forecasters from the Livingston survey data. Figure 3 displays the magnitude of investor be- lief distortion, initially determined using asset prices alone and later combined with survey expectations. Without market frictions, the minimal belief distortion necessary to be consis- tent with only asset prices, as measured by \u03b4SR, stands at 70.6%, whereas accommodating both asset prices and survey expectations raises this distortion to 88.8%. This suggests a signi\ufb01cant discrepancy, up to 88.8%, from the maximum Sharpe Ratio under the objective belief when investor beliefs are identi\ufb01ed using both asset prices and survey expectations. Incorporating bid-ask spreads of 0.5% and 1% for annual holdings markedly lowers the necessary belief distortion to align with only asset prices, to 52.6% and 41.1% respectively. This represents a notable reduction of 25% and 42% from the frictionless market baseline, where the minimum deviation from Rational Expectations (RE) was recorded at 70.6%. Moreover, when these levels of bid-ask spreads are factored in, the distortion needed for consistency with both asset prices and survey expectations is further reduced to 61.8% and 48.2%. This shift signi\ufb01es a substantial decline from the 88.8% distortion observed when markets are assumed to be frictionless. Panel (b) of Figure 3 illustrates these changes, highlighting a 30% and 46% decrease in distortion when annual costs of 0.5% and 1% are assumed, respectively. The analysis, as illustrated in \ufb01gure 3, maps out a nuanced landscape of transaction cost 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979and belief distortion. Three distinct regions emerge: 1) A white area indicating levels of transaction cost and belief distortion where no belief aligns with asset prices. 2) A light gray area showing levels where there are beliefs consistent with either asset prices or survey expectations, but not both, signaling a need for additional adjustment in beliefs. 3) A dark gray area encompassing levels where there are beliefs consistent with both asset prices and survey expectations. The discrepancy between asset prices and survey expectations is quanti\ufb01able by examining the extra distortion required to meet survey expectations in addition to existing asset pricing conditions. This additional distortion is represented by the light gray area in Figure 3. In a frictionless market, this discrepancy amounts to 18.3%, which notably decreases to 9.2% and 7.1% with the introduction of bid-ask spreads of 0.5% and 1%, respectively. When extremely high transaction costs are assumed, exceeding a 4% annual bid-ask spread, the asset pricing relation (3) becomes uninformative, as it identi\ufb01es a very large set of admis- sible investor beliefs. Hence, the estimated belief distortion, derived from reconciling both assetpricesandsurveyexpectations, reducestotheminimallevelofdistortionrequiredsolely for aligning with survey expectations. This minimum level of belief distortion is identi\ufb01ed to be 14.5%. This means that there exists a belief consistent with survey expectations and has a maximum Sharpe Ratio that di\ufb00ers by no more than 14.5% from the one computed under the objective belief. 4.4 Investor Belief Distortion Across Di\ufb00erent Investor Sophisti- cation Levels The next analysis focuses on three distinct sources of survey expectations, di\ufb00erentiated by the sophistication level of the respondents. Firstly, the Livingston Survey data, which encompasses one-year ahead market price expec- tations from professional forecasters, is used as a representation of sophisticated investors. In 21 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979contrast, the survey data from Nagel and Xu [2022] provides insights into the one-year ahead market return expectations of individual investors. Additionally, the CFO survey data o\ufb00ers perspectives on the expectations of chief \ufb01nancial o\ufb03cers and others with \ufb01nancial decision- making roles. The core of this analysis hinges on comparing the expectations across these investor categories, primarily in terms of their deviation from Rational Expectations and their alignment, or lack thereof, with asset prices.",

Within this construct, the minimal devi- ation from Rational Expectations necessary to pricing portfolios formed on size and book- to-market ratios, while accommodating the expectations of sophisticated investors, is 88%. In comparison, this deviation escalates to 146.8% and 150.8% for individual investors and CFOs, respectively. These \ufb01gures suggest two key points: \ufb01rstly, the expectations of pro- fessional forecasters tend to be more closely aligned with Rational Expectations than those of individual investors and CFOs; secondly, the expectations of CFOs are not better than those of individual investors in terms of proximity to Rational Expectations.

Compared to the frictionless market assumption, a 0.5% bid-ask spread as- sumption alone leads to a drop of the investor belief distortion by 30%, 37%, and 41% when expectations of sophisticated, individual investors and CFOs are considered. How do aggregate market expectations di\ufb00er among investors of varying sophistication, par- ticularly in relation to alignment with portfolio returns? As discussed in the preceding section, the additional belief distortion necessary to accommodate survey expectations once asset pricing relations are satis\ufb01ed is an indication of the discrepancy between asset prices and expectations of the aggregate market. Under the assumption of frictionless markets, this additional distortion is notably higher for individual investors and CFOs, at 88.2% and 106.7% respectively. These values are substantially larger \u2013 approximately \ufb01ve to six times \u2013 22 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979compared to the additional distortion required to align with the expectations of sophisticated investors. This \ufb01nding reinforces the notion that CFOs\u2019 expectations about the aggregate market are not more closely aligned with portfolio returns than those of individual investors. The comprehensive comparison of the three sets of survey data, as depicted in \ufb01gures 3 and 4, indicates a signi\ufb01cant pattern. Among the surveys examined, the Livingston survey data, which represents aggregate market expectations of sophisticated investors, shows a closer alignment with actual asset prices. This observation is derived from the fact that investor beliefs, which are consistent with asset pricing moments, require less adjustment to be in line with the expectations outlined in the Livingston survey. 4.5 InvestorBeliefDistortionAcrossDi\ufb00erentEquityMarketSeg- ments In this section the analysis focuses on the variation of investor beliefs across di\ufb00erent seg- ments of the equity market. In particular, it examines belief distortions among investors tradinginvariouscategoriesofstocks, includinglarge, small, value, growth, winner, andloser stocks. Following Ghosh, Korteweg, and Xu [2020], portfolios based on size, book-to-market ratios, and momentum are employed for this purpose. In what follows, the survey-driven expectations of the aggregate market is given by sophisticated investors. The empirical analysis is driven by two main questions: Firstly, to what degree investors\u2019 deviations from Rational Expectations vary based on the market segments they engage in? And secondly, To what extent these belief distortions depend on the assumed trading costs. A key part of the analysis is to explore the e\ufb00ects of two types of trading costs on belief distortions: bid-ask spreads, and short selling costs. This approach will help in discerning the relationship between trading costs and investor beliefs across di\ufb00erent segments of the equity market. 23 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=42779794.5.1 Bid-Ask Spreads Let us consider investors who face transaction costs, speci\ufb01cally in the form of bid-ask spreads. The ensuing analysis, reported in Table 1, is based on: \ufb01rstly, by pricing annual returns from 1960 to 2019 across a spectrum of assets \u2013 large, small, growth, value, winners, and losers; and secondly, by matching survey expectations, drawing from the Livingston survey data. The table reports the results encompassing both the maximum Sharpe Ratio deviation bound, \u03b4SR, of equation (15) and the minimum \u03c72-divergence, \u03b4, of equation (11). The corresponding bootstrapped 95% con\ufb01dence intervals are reported alongside the belief distortion metrics. The analysis is conducted under two scenarios: a frictionless market setting and a market scenario factoring in an annual 0.5% bid-ask spread. The analysis of investor beliefs reveals a diverse picture of distortions, when comparing investors in di\ufb00erent market segments. Notably, beliefs of investors in small stocks exhibit more distortion when contrasted with those trading in larger assets.",

        "content": "In a similar vein, the beliefs of those investing in growth (or loser) stocks are markedly more distorted compared to their counterparts in value (or winner) stocks. Focusing on the extent of these distortions, a pronounced deviation in the beliefs of loser stock investors is observed, with the maximum Sharpe Ratio deviation bound at 100%. Investors in small stocks follow, with a deviation bound of 60%. When factoring in a 0.5% annual bid-ask spread, the observed deviations in investor beliefs signi\ufb01cantly change compared to a frictionless market scenario. For investors in large assets, the Sharpe Ratio deviation bound declines from 49% to 31%. For small assets, this deviation drops from 60% to 23%. Distortion for investors in growth assets has a reduction from 65% to 40%, while that in value assets decreases from 54% to 34%. For winner asset investors, the deviation bound lessens from 57% to 45%, and for those investing in loser assets, it falls from 100% to 86%. Attributable to the 0.5% annual bid-ask spread, this adjustment in belief distortion explains 24 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=427797936% of the distortion for large asset investors, 60% for small asset investors, 38% for both growth and value asset investors, 20% for winner asset investors, and 14% for loser asset investors. On average, across these market segments, the inclusion of a 0.5% annual bid-ask spread leads to a 34% reduction in belief distortion. These \ufb01ndings clearly indicate that deviations from Rational Expectations, initially estimated based on a frictionless market assumption, are indeed partly due to trading costs. The impact of these trading costs is particularly signi\ufb01cant in the context of small assets. For value and growth stocks, the e\ufb00ect of trading costs is not markedly di\ufb00erent, whereas their in\ufb02uence is comparatively less for momentum stocks. 4.5.2 Short Selling Costs This section probes whether divergences from Rational Expectations in investor beliefs are di\ufb00erently impacted by the costs associated with the short and long positions in trading. Let us consider investors who incur transaction costs only when short selling assets. Figure 5 delineates the divergence from Rational Expectations among investors, categorized by the type of assets they trade \u2013 encompassing large, small, growth, value, winning, and losing stocks. The analysis spans four market conditions: a frictionless environment, markets with short selling costs of 0.5% and 1% per annum, and a market setting where short selling is entirely precluded. An annual short selling cost of 0.5% (1%) accounts for 42% (60%) of the belief distortion, estimated assuming frictionless markets, in investors of small stocks. For those trading in large and value stocks, these \ufb01gures are 21% (38%), and for growth stocks, they are 23% (36%). In the categories of winner and loser stocks, the distortions are quanti\ufb01ed at 12% (23%) and 6% (11%) respectively. Notably, entirely eliminating short selling aligns the belief distortion closely with that derived from survey expectations alone, as depicted by the horizontal blue line in Figure 5. However, across all these market scenarios, the Rational 25 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979Expectation Hypothesis is consistently rejected at a 95% con\ufb01dence level. These results underscores the critical impact of transaction costs on the deviation from Rational Expectations, particularly highlighting the distinct e\ufb00ects of short selling costs and bid-ask spreads. Short selling costs exclusively a\ufb00ect the short side of trades, while bid-ask spreads impact both sides. Let us consider two scenarios: one with a 0.5% bid-ask spread, imposing a 0.5% cost on both long and short legs of each trade, and another with only a 0.5% short selling cost on the short legs. The results, presented in Table 1 and Figure 6, demonstrate that short selling costs are more in\ufb02uential in explaining deviations from Rational Expectations - estimated assuming frictionless market assumptions - than bid-ask spreads. This e\ufb00ect is most pronounced with small stocks, where 80% of the reduction in belief distortion, attributed to bid-ask spreads, is actually due to the costs on the short leg of trades. Across di\ufb00erent market segments, this impact consistently exceeds 60%. In summary, this analysis demonstrates that transaction costs, particularly those associated with short selling, play a pivotal role in explaining the deviations from Rational Expectations initially estimated assuming frictionless markets.",

This least distorted belief serves as a lens to examine biases proposed by behavioral \ufb01nance literature as explanations for market anomalies, particularly the value-growth anomaly. 26 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979The value-growth anomaly, the observation that over long periods value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks, has always received attention in \ufb01nance literature that provides both risk- or mispricing-based explanations. A predominant mispricing explanation posits that investors display systematic optimism for growth stocks and pessimism for value stocks, often extrapolating future growth from historical patterns, see Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny [1994], Porta, Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny [1997] and Piotroski and So [2012], among others. The identi\ufb01ed investor belief in this study is suitable for probing whether investors indeed exhibit excessive pessimism towards value stocks and optimism towards growth stocks. This analysis also explores if these biases diminish when trading costs are considered. To this end, the probability distribution of returns for speci\ufb01c portfolios is investigated: large and growth stocks, small and growth stocks, large and value stocks, and small and value stocks. The study involves three probability distributions: 1) distribution under the objective belief, estimated as the empirical distribution, 2) distribution under the investor belief characterized by equation (13) under frictionless market assumption, and 3) distri- bution under the investor belief with a 1% annual bid-ask spread assumption.10Figure 7 displays the probability distributions of annual returns for these portfolios under both ob- jective and subjective beliefs. These beliefs are aligned with one-year ahead market return expectations of professional forecasters and the pricing of the assets in question. A key \ufb01nding is that a di\ufb00erence in the book-to-market ratio notably separates the subjec- tive and objective return distributions, more so than a di\ufb00erence in size. The subjective probability distribution for value stocks (both small and large) leans left compared to the objective distribution, indicating a pronounced pessimistic bias towards value stocks. This 10The probability distribution under the investor belief is a transformation of the empirical distribution under the objective belief weighted by the change of belief given by equation (13). 27 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979aligns with the mispricing explanation of the value/growth e\ufb00ect. Notably, the probability of a negative net return for value assets is about 39% under the least distorted investor belief, while this probability is 29% under the objective distribution. This tilt in the subjective probability distortion persists across di\ufb00erent levels of trading costs, suggesting that trading costs are not the primary drivers of the disparities between objective and subjective value stock return distributions. In contrast, Figure 7 reveals no substantial bias in the probability distribution of growth stock returns. The probability of a negative net return is roughly 35% for growth stocks under both subjective and objective beliefs, challenging the notion of investor over-optimism towards growth stocks. Additionally, as trading costs are factored in, the distributions under investor and objective beliefs converge. In conclusion, investor beliefs, extracted from both asset prices and survey expectations, sup- port the idea of undue pessimism towards value stocks but do not corroborate the literature\u2019s assertion of excessive investor optimism towards growth stocks. 4.7 Robustness Inthissection, Irevisitsomeoftheresultsintheprevioussections, underalternativesettings.

        "content": "The results are based on investor beliefs that are identi\ufb01ed by matching survey expectations from the Livingston survey and asset pricing moment conditions for portfolios of large, small, growth, value, winner, and loser stocks. When investor beliefs are identi\ufb01ed using the CAPM SDF or the recursive utility-based SDF, a 0.5% bid-ask spread explains a similar fraction of the belief distortion computed assuming frictionless markets: 35% for the CAPM SDF and 36% for the recursive utility- based SDF. However, when the power utility-based SDF is used to identify investor beliefs, the component explained by a 0.5% bid-ask spread is 26%. Moreover, in all the settings, bid-ask spreads explain the largest fraction of the belief distortion for small stock investors. As Figure 8 illustrates, the extent to which transaction costs explain belief distortions in di\ufb00erent market segments varies with the SDF model used. Nonetheless, in all scenarios, the component of the belief distortion estimated assuming frictionless markets that is explained by a 0.5% bid-ask spread is economically important. Figure 9 compares results using \u03c72and Entropy divergences to quantify the deviation of investor beliefs from the objective belief. The Entropy divergence between beliefs PandP0 is de\ufb01ned as entr(P,P0) :=EP0[Nlog(N)], whereN=dP dP0. As Figure 9 reveals, whether using \u03c72or Entropy divergence, the \ufb01ndings are virtually the same regarding the component of belief distortion, computed in frictionless markets, that can be attributed to transaction costs. 5 Conclusions This paper quanti\ufb01es the extent to which investor beliefs must diverge from Rational Expec- tations (RE) to align with asset prices and survey data in a market characterized by frictions. A key innovation of the paper is to identify investor beliefs using jointly asset prices and 29 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979expectations about the aggregate market from survey data. Moreover, I provided a metric of deviation from RE that is interpretable as an upper bound for the di\ufb00erence between the maximum Sharpe Ratios according to the investor and the econometrician. This approach facilitates an economic assessment of how varying trading costs in\ufb02uence the distortion of investor subjective beliefs. The measurement of the deviation from RE is based on satisfying the asset pricing conditions for annual returns of portfolios with diverse characteristics and matching the one-year ahead market return expectations of individual investors, CFOs, and professional forecasters. The results reveal that for CAPM-driven investor beliefs, about 30% (46%) of the belief distortion assumed in frictionless markets can be attributed to a 0.5% (1%) annual trading cost. I document signi\ufb01cant heterogeneity in terms of the belief distortion magnitude that can be explained by market frictions, across marginal investors of di\ufb00erent segments of the equity market. In particular, I show that 60% of the belief distortion for investors in small stocks computed assuming frictionless markets can be explained by a 0.5% annual trading cost. In the cross-section of survey market return expectations, I \ufb01nd that, while deviations from RE are always signi\ufb01cant, they are an order of magnitude smaller for the beliefs of professional forecasters compared to the beliefs of individual investors and CFOs. Moreover, CFOs\u2019 expectations about the aggregate market are not more closely aligned with asset prices than those of individual investors. When comparing costs relative to long and short legs of trades, it emerges that the costs linked to short selling, are critical factors in explaining the deviations from RE that are initially assumed in models of frictionless markets. The e\ufb00ect is most striking for small stocks, where a substantial 80% of the reduction in belief distortion, initially attributed to bid-ask spreads, is in fact attributable to costs incurred on the short side of trades. Finally, comparing the probability distributions of returns across portfolios with varying characteristics under investor beliefs, I \ufb01nd strong evidence for overly pessimistic subjective 30 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979expectations of value stock returns. However, the results do not corroborate the commonly held view in the literature of excessive investor optimism towards growth stocks.",

Figure 10 plots the half e\ufb00ective bid-ask spread of \ufb01rms included in both Trade and Quote (TAQ) and Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) databases. The e\ufb00ective spreads are estimated following Holden and Jacobsen [2014].12The pooled average bid-ask spread for stocks in both databases is of 0.75% from 1994 to 2020. However, there is a large variation both over time and across assets as reported in Figure 10. Panel (a) shows the di\ufb00erence in terms of the bid-ask spread between large and small stocks, given by the top and bottom tertiles. The average bid-ask spread is 0.1% for large assets and 1.7% for small assets, respectively. Value stocks have wider bid-ask spreads relative to Growth stocks as shown in panel (b). The average bid-ask spread for value stocks is 1.04% and 0.58% for growth stocks, respectively. As reported in panel (c), the di\ufb00erence between bid-ask spreads for loser and winner stocks is less pronounced. The average bid-ask spread for loser stocks is 0.94% and for winner stocks is 0.72%. One of the costs investors face when short selling is the loan fee. Sa\ufb03 and Sigurdsson [2011] document that the average loan fee is close to 0.68% per annum with a standard deviation of 1.61%, by analyzing lending activities between 2005 and 2008 of large \ufb01rms in the US security lending industry. Cohen, Diether, and Malloy [2007] show that between 1999 and 2003 the average loan fee is 2.60% per annum based on lending data of a large market maker in small stock lending market. D\u2019avolio [2002] \ufb01nds that the value-weighted loan fee is 0.25% per annum using information on the loan supply of a large \ufb01nancial institution from 2000 to 2001. Moreover, loan fees vary across assets based on various characteristics. Cohen, Diether, and Malloy [2007] \ufb01nd that stocks above (below) the NYSE median market capitalization have an average lending fee of 0.39% (3.94%) per annum. Geczy, Musto, and Reed [2002] show that the average fee for growth (loser) stocks is higher than value (winner) stocks based on data from a US custody bank between 1998 and 1999. Sa\ufb03 and Sigurdsson [2011] similarly report that \ufb01rms with higher book-to-market ratios have lower loan fees. An important limitation to short selling is the limited lending supply of stocks. D\u2019avolio [2002] documents that 16% of the stocks in the CRSP database, mostly small, are impossible to short. Sa\ufb03 and Sigurdsson [2011] \ufb01nd that the average lending supply amounts only to 23.5% of total shares outstanding and that less than 2% of market capitalization is available to borrow for about 25% of \ufb01rms. These empirical \ufb01ndings imply that limited lending supply is the main obstacle investors face when short selling. 12The authors provide the SAS codes on their Web page. 42 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=427797919941995199619971998199920002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016201720182019202001234Bid Ask Spread (%)Small Average Large(a) Size 1994199519961997199819992000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018201920200.51.01.52.02.5Bid Ask Spread (%)Value Average Growth (b) Book to Market 1994199519961997199819992000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018201920200.51.01.52.02.5Bid Ask Spread (%)Losers Average Winners (c) Momentum Figure 10: E\ufb00ective Half Bid-Ask Spreads.

I provide the framework for the general setting in which investors\u2019 expectation EP[Yt+1]belongs to a convex set D\u2282Rk. This allows to account for measurement error by setting, for example, by settingDequal to the 95% con\ufb01dence interval of the survey expectation E[Yt+1]. Let us collect all random variables in one vector as vt+1(\u03b8) = (M(\u03b8,Zt+1)X/prime t+1,Yt+1)/primeand all the dual parameters as u= (w/prime,\u03b1/prime,\u03b3)/prime. Then by Proposition 3 we can write the belief distortion as: \u03b4= inf \u03b8\u2208\u0398J(\u03b8)\u22121,whereJ(\u03b8) := sup uF(vt+1(\u03b8),u),with F(vt+1(\u03b8),u) :=EP0[\u2212(\u2212M(\u03b8,Zt+1)X/prime t+1w\u2212Y/prime t+1\u03b1\u2212\u03b3)2 +/4]\u2212\u03c0(X/prime t+1w)\u2212\u03c3D(\u03b1)\u2212\u03b3(B1) and\u03c3D(\u03b1) := supz\u2208Dz/prime\u03b1. The estimator of \u03b4, which is denoted by \u02c6\u03b4, is de\ufb01ned as the empirical counterpart given by \u02c6\u03b4:= inf \u03b8\u2208\u0398JT(\u03b8)\u22121,whereJT(\u03b8) := sup uFT(vt+1(\u03b8),u),with FT(vt+1(\u03b8),u) :=1 TT/summationdisplay t=1\u2212/parenleftBig \u2212M(\u03b8,Zt+1)X/prime t+1w\u2212Y/prime t+1\u03b1\u2212\u03b3/parenrightBig2 +\u2212P/prime tw\u2212h(w)\u2212\u03c3D(\u03b1)\u2212\u03b3 . (B2) Let us now consider the following assumptions which allow us to derive the asymptotic properties of the estimator \u03b4T. Assumption 1. The parameter space \u0398for\u03b8is compact with non empty interior. Assumption 2. The parametric SDF M(\u03b8,Zt+1)is continuous in \u03b8for almost every Zt+1. Assumptions 1 and 2 restrict the family of parametric SDF family and its parameter space and will be useful to use the asymptotic properties of JT(\u03b8)to derive those of \u02c6\u03b4.

In the case of di\ufb00erentiable transaction cost function h, Assumption 4 can be substituted with standard equicontinuity condition.

The next proposition characterizes the asymptotic distributions of the estimator of investor belief distortion under the above-mentioned assumptions. Proposition4.

If the set \u0398\u2217is a singleton, then the estimator converges to a normally distributed variable. Bootstrap I now provide, following Chen, Hansen, and Hansen [2020], a suitable bootstrap method for estimating the limit distribution of the belief distortion metric. The following proposition is an application of the numerical delta method, see Hong and Li [2018][Th. 3.1]. Proposition 5.

Proof of Proposition 3 In what follows I prove Proposition 3 for the general setting where investor expectation EP[Yt+1]belongs to a convex set D\u2282Rk. This allows to account for measurement error by setting, for example, Dequal to the 95% con\ufb01dence interval of the aggregated survey expectationE[Yt+1]. The proof follows mainly from Korsaye, Quaini, and Trojani [2019]. Proof.Since the beliefs in P=Ph\u2229PSEare absolutely continuous with respect to P0, for each P\u2208Pthere exists a random variable Nsuch thatN=dP/dP0. Assuming that M(\u03b8)Xt+1\u2208Lp(P0)for somep >1, and using the fact that E[(N\u22121)2] =E[N2]\u22121, we can write belief distortion as \u03b4= inf\u03b8\u03b4(\u03b8)\u22121, with \u03b4(\u03b8) := inf N\u2208LqE[\u03c6+(N)]s.t.E[N] = 1, E [NM(\u03b8)Xt+1]\u2212Pt\u2208Ch, E [NYt+1]\u2208D, (C4) whereCh:={\u03b7\u2208Rn:\u03b7/primew\u2264h(w)},1/q+ 1/p= 1, all expectations and Lp-spaces are under the objective belief P0, and\u03c6+(N)is de\ufb01ned as N2ifNis positive and in\ufb01nity otherwise. For simplicity, I suppress the SDF variable Zt+1from the notation. Let us rewrite (C4) as follows: inf N\u2208LpE[\u03c6+(N)]/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright s(N)+\u03b6{1}(E[N]) +\u03b6Pt+Ch(E[NM(\u03b8)Xt+1]) +\u03b6D(E[NYt+1]) /bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright g(L\u03b8N),(C5) where\u03b6A(\u00b7)is indicator function of set Awhich is equal to zero if the argument belongs to setAand in\ufb01nity otherwise, s:Lq\u2192Rwiths(N) =E[\u03c6+(N)],L\u03b8:Lq\u2192Rn+1+k withL\u03b8(N) = (E[NM(\u03b8)Xt+1],E[N],E[NYt+1])andg:Rn+1+k\u2192Rwithg(u1,\u03be,u2) = \u03b6Pt+Ch(u1) +\u03b6{1}(\u03be) +\u03b6D(u2). By assumption, for a given \u03b8there exists a belief \u02dcPequivalent to P0such that for any w\u2208Rn E\u02dcP[M(\u03b8)X/prime t+1w]\u2212P/prime tw< h(w), which with further assumption that E\u02dcP[Yt+1]\u2208ri(D), implies that the following set is not empty: N(\u03b8) :={N\u2208Lq ++, E [N] = 1, E [NM(\u03b8)Xt+1]\u2212Pt\u2208ri(Ch), E [NYt+1]\u2208ri(D)}, 47 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4277979whereLq ++consists of P0-a.s. strictly positive elements and riis the relative interior.14This will be used now to prove that L\u03b8(qri(doms))\u2229ri(domg)/negationslash=\u2205.15(C6) In particular given some \u02dcN\u2208N(\u03b8), we will show that L\u03b8(\u02dcN)\u2208L\u03b8(qri(doms))\u2229ri(domg). The domain of the function gis given by (P+Ch)\u00d7{1}\u00d7D, and its relative interior is given by (P+ri(Ch))\u00d7{1}\u00d7ri(D). SinceE[\u02dcN] = 1,E[\u02dcNM(\u03b8Xt+1)]\u2212Pt\u2208ri(Ch)and E[\u02dcNf(Yt+1)]\u2208ri(D), we have that L\u03b8(\u02dcN)\u2208ri(domg). Moreover, the fact that (0,\u221e)\u2282 dom\u03c6by [Borwein and Lewis, 1991, Lemma 2.3] implies that domE[\u03c6(\u00b7)]\u2229qri(Lq +)\u2282 qri(E[\u03c6+(\u00b7)])and since \u02dcN\u2208Lq ++andE[\u03c6(\u02dcN)]<\u221e, we obtain that \u02dcN\u2208qri(doms)and thusL\u03b8(\u02dcN)\u2208L\u03b8(qri(doms)), thus showing that the set in (C6) is not empty. Sincesandgare both convex, closed and lower semi-continuous, by [Borwein and Lewis, 1992, Corollary 4.3], we obtain \u03b4(\u03b8) = max w\u2208Rn,\u03b1\u2208Rk,\u03b3\u2208R\u2212s\u2217(LT \u03b8(\u2212w,\u2212\u03b1,\u2212\u03b3))\u2212g\u2217(w,\u03b1,\u03b3), wheres\u2217andg\u2217are legendre transforms of sandg, respectively, and LT \u03b8is the adjoint operator of the linear operator L\u03b8.16The adjoint map corresponding to L\u03b8is given by LT \u03b8(\u2212w,\u2212\u03b1,\u2212\u03b3) =\u2212M(\u03b8)X/prime t+1w\u2212Y/prime t+1\u03b1\u2212\u03b3. Let us now compute s\u2217andg\u2217. By [Rock- afellar,1968, Th. 2] s\u2217=E[\u03c6\u2217 +(\u00b7)]. Moreover, wehave g\u2217(w,\u03b3,\u03b1) =P/prime tw+h(w)+\u03c3D(\u03b1)+\u03b3, where\u03c3D(\u00b7)is the support function of set D. Thus, we obtain \u03b4(\u03b8) = max w\u2208Rn,\u03b1\u2208Rk,\u03b3\u2208RE[\u2212\u03c6\u2217 +(\u2212M(\u03b8)X/prime t+1w\u2212Y/prime t+1\u03b1\u2212\u03b3)]\u2212P/prime tw\u2212h(w)\u2212\u03c3D(\u03b1)\u2212\u03b3 , therefore \u03b4=\u2212sup \u03b8inf w\u2208Rn,\u03b1\u2208Rk,\u03b3\u2208RE[\u03c6\u2217 +(\u2212M(\u03b8)X/prime t+1w\u2212Y/prime t+1\u03b1\u2212\u03b3)] +P/prime tw+h(w) +\u03c3D(\u03b1) +\u03b3\u22121.

So Massachusetts Institute of Technology Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management Sloan School of Management Kevin Smith Stanford University Graduate School of Business June 8, 2023 Abstract We document the growth of retail options trading and provide evidence that retail investors are drawn to options by anticipated spikes in volatility. Retail investors purchase options in a concentrated fashion before earnings announcements, particularly those with greater expected abnormal volatility. Comparing across asset markets, we also find retail investors disproportionately trade options over stocks as anticipated announcement volatility increases. In doing so, retail investors display a trio of wealth-depleting behaviors: they overpay for options relative to realized volatility, incur enormous bid-ask spreads, and sluggishly respond to announcements. These translate to retail losses of 5-to-9% on average, and 10-to-14% for high expected volatility announcements. \u2217First draft: January 11, 2022.

We thank the Nasdaq Stock Market for generously sharing data used in this paper. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=40501651 Introduction The COVID pandemic coincided with a dramatic rise in retail investor participation in options markets. In 2020 alone, retail investors accounted for more than $250 billion of total single-name option volume. At the time of this writing, the SEC, in conjunction with local jurisdictions, are considering regulations focused on retail investor participation in options markets. These policy considerations crucially depend on how retail investors behave, affect prices, and incur gains and losses in these markets. The objective of this study is to provide timely, large-sample evidence on these considerations. Using recent data on options trades broken down by clientele groups, we address three central questions. First, what drives retail investor participation in options markets cross- sectionally and over time? Second, how does retail demand influence the cross-section of option prices, and how does these factors differ across equity and option markets? Finally, and perhaps most importantly, how do retail investors perform when trading options and who benefits from their mistakes? We show that retail investors are drawn to purchase options prior to earnings announce- ments, particularly those expected to trigger high volatility, where this behavior dispropor- tionately concentrates in options relative to stocks. This behavior is extraordinary because these events create precipitous jumps in price, and so present option writers with large, un- hedgable risk. As a result, retail investors pay hefty premiums for these options relative to realized volatility and incur abnormally high transaction costs. We further show that they sluggishly close their option positions post-announcement even as their prices predictably decay. Taken together, these patterns lead retail investors to suffer double-digit percentage losses when trading options around earnings announcements. Our evidence yields an important insight for researchers and regulatory debates focused onretailinvestorsthroughthelensofequitymarkets. Specifically, ourresultssuggestthatin- ferences regarding retail investors\u2019 sophistication, contribution to price discovery, and wealth dynamics are likely incomplete when confined to equity markets. Prior research shows that Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165retail investors earn excess stock returns around earnings announcements on average, con- sistent with retail investors providing liquidity and benefiting from private information re- garding firms\u2019 earnings (e.g., Kaniel, Liu, Saar, and Titman 2012; Kelley and Tetlock 2013; Barrot, Kaniel, and Sraer 2016; Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang 2021). In contrast, our results indicate that retail traders demand liquidity and seemingly lack private information when trading in options around earnings announcements, suffering large losses as a result. Given past evidence that investors are more prone to behavioral mistakes in complex settings (Hirshleifer 2001; Gao, Hu, Kelly, Peng, and Zhu 2022) and learn to avoid these mistakes only with experience (Seru, Shumway, and Stoffman 2010; Linnainmaa 2011), the difference in retail behavior across markets likely reflects the complexity to trading in options relative to stocks and the expanding set of retail investors that trade options.",

        "content": "Our main analyses use a recent dataset from the Nasdaq Stock Market that details buying and selling volumes at the contract-day level for options traded on Nasdaq and OMX PHLX exchanges. These data account for approximately 25% of market-wide option volume over our 2010-2021 sample window. A key feature of the Nasdaq data is that it allows us to observe whether a trade originated from retail, professional customers, market makers, firms, or broker/dealers (see Section 2 for details). To conduct cross-market comparisons, we merge this data with estimated retail net trading behavior in equity markets. To motivate our focus on retail behavior around earnings announcements, we begin by documenting several empirical facts present in our sample: 1. The extent of retail trading in options has grown substantially over time, increasing more than ten-fold over the past decade in terms of dollar volume traded. 2. For all clientele groups, option trading activity concentrates around firms\u2019 quarterly earnings announcements relative to non-announcement periods. 3. Retailinvestorsandmarketmakersarethemostactiveclientelegroupsaroundearnings announcements, with market makers largely offsetting positions by retail investors. These patterns indicate that retail trade is likely an increasingly important determinant of both retail traders\u2019 wealth and option prices, particularly around earnings announcements. 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165Our main tests explore the link between retail option demand and the extent of expected announcement volatility (EAV). These tests are motivated by prior evidence that retail tends to gravitate towards firms with more media coverage (e.g., Barber and Odean 2008) and that the media is more likely to cover earnings announcements with larger anticipated spikes in volatility (e.g., Noh, So, and Verdi 2021). Combined with theories and evidence of investors\u2019 preference for volatile assets (e.g., Baker, Bradley, and Wurgler 2011; Barberis and Xiong 2012), we predict retail investor option demand increases with the amount of volatility expected at the announcement. We show retail investors indeed purchase options in a concentrated fashion ahead of announcements with higher EAV. We measure EAV using the term-structure of implied volatilityacrossoption-maturitydates(PatellandWolfson1979;Dubinsky, Johannes, Kaeck, and Seeger 2019). However, to mitigate concerns that our results are mechanically driven by the use of equilibrium prices to predict quantities, we also proxy for EAV using a firm\u2019s largest absolute return over recent quarterly earnings announcements. This approach is based on the idea that investors and the media use historical announcement volatility to forecast volatility around subsequent announcements and that extreme past events have an especially strong impact on investors\u2019 beliefs (Bali, Cakici, and Whitelaw 2011). Using both approaches, we show retail investors take large net long positions in the days immediately prior to high EAV announcements. Moreover, as EAV rises, overall retail trading behavior increases in options relative to stocks. This pattern concentrates in firms with pre-announcement media coverage, suggesting attention effects strongly contribute to pre-announcementretailoptiondemand. Totheextentthatretaildemandwasinsteaddriven by a preference for lottery-like payoffs (e.g., Han and Kumar 2013; Boyer and Vorkink 2014), we would expect their purchases to be focused in options with lottery-like return profiles, i.e., out-of-the-money options with short maturities. On the contrary, ahead of high EAV announcements, retail investors primarily purchase at-the-money options, and are equally likely to buy long- and short-dated options. 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165Lakonishok, Lee, Pearson, and Poteshman (2007) and Mahani and Poteshman (2008) use proprietary datasets similar to ours from the 1990s to explore the option strategies that investorgroupsfollow. Lakonishoketal. (2007)showthatindividualinvestorstendtobenet- short options but use options to speculate on growth stocks (i.e., firms with high market-to- book ratios). Mahani and Poteshman (2008) find these investors similarly purchase options in growth stocks before earnings announcements, but that this behavior does not appear to be driven by attention effects. Our study differs by showing that retail investors are drawn to options by anticipated spikes in volatility around these announcements, and that their option purchases sharply increase not only on an absolute basis, but also relative to their purchases in stocks. These findings, which became even more prominent during the COVID pandemic, complement the evidence in Barber, Huang, Odean, and Schwarz (2021) that recent generations of retail investors behave differently than those documented in studies from the 1990s.",

        "content": "Retail\u2019s focus on high EAV announcements is especially notable because the unhedgable risk that option writers face peaks around these events, which are expected to create large price jumps. Since most retail option demand ahead of high EAV announcements is ab- sorbed by a single clientele group, market makers, demand-based option pricing theory pre- dicts market makers are likely to charge exceptionally high premiums to accommodate this retail demand (Garleanu, Pedersen, and Poteshman 2009). Consistent with this theory, we find that retail investors\u2019 option demands generate large price impact prior to high EAV earnings announcements. For announcements in the top quintile of retail option purchases, option-implied variances escalate by roughly 40% more in the days immediately prior to the announcement dates compared to announcements with no such purchases. Wenextconducttwosetsofteststhatillustratehowretail\u2019sproclivitytowardspurchasing options prior to high EAV announcements depletes their wealth. In the first, we showcase three factors that shape the dynamics of retail investor performance around earnings an- nouncements. In the second, we take a novel, aggregate approach that tracks retail positions 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165in event-time to directly quantify how these factors combine to impact retail wealth. The first of three factors contributing to retail investment performance is that options earn significantly negative returns during earnings announcements, particularly those with high EAV. For these tests, we focus on at-the-money straddle returns because they allow us to study retail investors\u2019 pricing of volatility separately from retail investors\u2019 ability to predict directional price moves in the stock market. We find these straddles underperform on high EAV announcement dates relative to low EAV announcement dates by a whopping 11%, on average ( t-statistic = 19.55). This suggests retail investors deplete their wealth by buying options ahead of anticipated spikes in volatility but, in doing so, overpay for these options relative to realized volatility. A second factor contributing to retail investors\u2019 performance is that they trade options with enormous bid-ask spreads, which predictably concentrate ahead of high EAV announce- ments. We conservatively estimate the transaction costs that retail traders incur by assum- ing they hold all options they purchase until maturity, and thus only pay half of the bid-ask spread. Among high EAV announcements, we find retail investors lose an average additional 9% of their investment due to this half-spread. These findings complement evidence in Bryz- galova, Pavlova, and Sikorskaya (2022) that option market makers appear to earn substantial profits by trading against retail order flow. The third factor we document is that retail investors compound their losses by continuing to hold onto their option positions post-announcement as their prices continue to decay. We find this appears to be driven in part by a disposition effect, in which retail investors fail to close underperforming positions. An implication of retail investors maintaining an abnormal net long option position is that option market makers continue to bear inventory risk in the post-announcement period. Thus, theories of demand pressure (e.g., Garleanu et al. 2009) predict straddle prices should remain elevated rather than falling immediately in concert with the decline in expected volatility. Consistent with retail holdings influencing option prices, we show that straddles continue to underperform over the two weeks following high 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165relative to low EAV announcements by an additional 9% ( t-statistic = 8.26). Using randomly generated pseudo-earnings-announcement dates, we show that our main findings concentrate specifically around earnings announcements rather than in non-announcement periods. These results indicate that earnings announcements are a key driver of retail participation in options markets and thus that event-time tests are crucial for understanding the behavioral biases that contribute to retail losses in options markets. Ourfinaltestsleveragethegranularityofourdatatomoredirectlytrackwealthdynamics in event-time relative to earnings announcements. We conduct these tests by cumulating positions for each clientele type and estimating their sensitivities to realized changes in price. As a complement to our straddle return tests, these tests provide a more precise picture of the wealth dynamics of retail investors after accounting for their concentrated positions in options ahead of high EAV announcements as well as conservative assumptions about the transaction costs they incur. Retail investors deplete their wealth on average by trading ahead of earnings announce- ments, but particularly so for the subsample of high EAV announcements.",

        "content": "After accounting for bid-ask spreads and making conservative assumptions about the price improvement they receive, we estimate that retail investors lose 5-to-9% of option investments around earnings announcements on average, and 10-to-14% for high EAV announcements. Taken together, our estimates indicate that retail investors lost approximately $3 billion on option invest- ments during our sample window. Market makers are the primary beneficiaries of these patterns, particularly in recent years coinciding with the COVID pandemic, resulting in large capital flows from retail to market makers. Importantly, the percentage losses we document are not only large on an absolute basis, but also large relative to the losses that retail investors incur trading options on the typical day. For instance, Bauer, Cosemans, and Eichholtz (2009) show that retail investors in the Netherlands lose an average of 1.81% per month on their option positions. Coupled with our findings, these results suggest retail\u2019s option trading is exceptionally costly around high 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165EAV announcements. Our findings are particularly relevant in light of increased regulatory scrutiny of retail trading in options markets. Whether and how to respond to the growth of retail options trading hinges upon understanding both their drivers and consequences. Thus, a key con- tribution of our paper is in showing that retail investors\u2019 options demands are driven by expected announcement volatility and that their demands have a first-order impact on mar- ket prices and wealth dynamics, in ways that are distinct from equity markets. We highlight that retail investors generate losses in options markets for three distinct reasons: they over- pay for options relative to realized volatility, trade in options with large bid-ask spreads, and continue to hold options post-announcement as their prices predictably decay. A second key insight of our paper is that the asset pricing implications of retail demand are notably different in both magnitude and form in options relative to stocks. In terms of magnitude, the inability of option market makers to hedge announcement risks results in the asset-pricing implications of retail demand being an order of magnitude larger in op- tions (\u223c15X) relative to the earnings announcement premium in stock markets (e.g., Barber, De George, Lehavy, and Trueman 2013), which is commonly attributed to retail demand pressure (e.g., Noh et al. 2021). In terms of form, we show the impact of retail demand on option prices has a long tail spanning the two weeks post-announcements. This is because retail investors not only buy options ahead of earnings announcements with high expected abnormal volatility, but also appear slow to close out their positions post-announcement. Finally, our study contributes by underscoring that inferences regarding retail investors\u2019 sophistication, contribution to price discovery, and wealth dynamics are likely incomplete when confined to equity markets. Our evidence that retail investors are contrarian is consis- tentwithevidencefromequitymarkets(e.g.,Kanieletal.2012;Barrotetal.2016). However, unlike that literature, which emphasizes how retail investors profit from providing market liquidity and increase market stability, we find the contrarian nature of retail investors in options markets generates wealth losses and equilibrium price distortions (as in Foucault, 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165Sraer, and Thesmar 2011). 2 Data Description and Descriptive Results 2.1 Data and Sample Construction We begin our sample construction with the Nasdaq Options Trade Outline (NOTO) and the PHLX Options Trade Outline (PHOTO) End-of-Day files provided to us by the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.1To our knowledge, we are the first to use these data to academically study options markets, but Lakonishok et al. (2007) use a similar, proprietary dataset from the 1990s. For each option traded on the Nasdaq Options Market (NOM) or Nasdaq PHLX (PHLX), these data provide the daily number of opening buys, opening sells, closing buys, and closing sells by five different categories of traders: customers, professional customers, market makers, broker/dealers, and firms. Opening buys (sells) refer to trades in which the trader initiates a new long (short) position in the particular option, while closing sells (buys) refer to trades in which the trader settles a previously established long (short) option position. These data cover all electronic trades that occur on the NOM and PHLX and also contain the daily low, high, open, and last trade prices for each option.",

The \u201cprofessional customer\u201d category captures persons and entities that are not broker/dealers and place more than 390 orders in listed options on average per day during a calendar month for their own beneficial accounts, where 390 corresponds to one trade per minute during trading hours. This category would include institutional investors that actively trade options, such as quantitative hedge funds. Our primary category of interest is \u201cnon-professional customer\u201d, which captures customers of the exchange trading on behalf of their own accounts that are not active enough to be classified as professional customers.2 1Formoredetailonthesedataoutsideofwhatisprovidedinthissection, see https://data.nasdaq.com/ databases/NOTO/documentation andhttps://data.nasdaq.com/databases/PHOTO/documentation . 2Choy and Wei (2012) studies the extent of retail trading activity using a related dataset from the CBOE 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165We measure the trading activity of retail investors using the non-professional customers category, which includes all options trades by retail investors. This measure is an imperfect proxy because it may also capture trades by small sophisticated non-retail investors and should thus be seen as complementary to other measures (e.g., Bryzgalova et al. 2022). However, our conversations with the data provider indicate that the presence of non-retail trades in the non-professional customer group is likely quite small. Nevertheless, in the presence of such measurement error, our descriptive results on the extent of retail trading activity (e.g., dollar volume) are likely overstated, while the extent of behavioral tendencies that we ascribe to retail investors are likely understated. Because we are primarily interested in the latter, we view the use of this measure as a proxy for retail investors\u2019 option trading as conservative. The remaining three clientele groups are market makers, broker/dealers, and firms. The \u201cmarket maker\u201d category captures registered/designated market makers on NOM and/or PHLX, which are required to maintain two-sided quotes during market hours for the options each entity is registered to trade. The \u201cbroker/dealer\u201d category captures institutions that may serve as market makers without formal registration, in addition to brokers trading on behalf of institutional clients. Finally, the \u201cfirm\u201d category captures entities that do not fall into the prior four categories, such as proprietary trading desks at an investment bank.3 We next collect the largest possible set of earnings announcements for US publicly traded firms between January 1st, 2010 and February 28th, 2021, which is the time period of our Nasdaq data.4We construct this set of earnings announcements by merging the Compustat over a 6-month window in 2006, and examines its link to stock returns but not option returns. 3The designation of a given option trade across clienteles is done on a trade-by-trade basis. This means that a given entity could show up under two clientele designations if, for example, it traded some options on behalf of clients but also traded on behalf of its own book. The entity is required to flag its order capacity according to who the order is for, which Nasdaq and PHLX use to prioritize and route orders. Unlike in equity markets, where retail order flow is internalized off-exchange, retail order flow in options is sent for execution on the exchanges, where it may fulfilled by a pre-arranged counterparty similar to payment for order flow in equity markets. 4In an earlier draft of this paper, we conducted our analysis using a sample that ended in December 31st, 2019. Our results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar when using that sample, suggesting the spike in retail options during 2020 and 2021 does not entirely drive our results. 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165QuarterlyFundamentalsfilewiththeThomsonReutersIBESdetailedEPSfileandtheCRSP Daily Stock File.

Panel A plots the average ratio of trading volume and open interest per un- derlying observed in our Nasdaq data relative to the total volume and open interest observed for that underlying in OptionMetrics.5The results show these data capture somewhere be- tween 20-30% of total options trading volume and 25-30% of open interest, suggesting they provide a reasonable characterization of aggregate option market activity. 2.2 Measures of Trader Positions Our primary tests examine the dynamics of holdings by clientele and their implications for returns. We track holdings for each earnings announcement by the daily change in the net option position of each clientele group, defined as follows: 5We define trading volume in our Nasdaq data as the sum of opening buys, opening sells, closing buys, and closing sells. Open interest for each option contract is provided directly. 10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165\u2206Trader Position t=100\u2217[Trader Opening Buyst+Trader Closing Buyst(1) \u2212Trader Opening Sellst\u2212Trader Closing Sellst], where trader buys and sells are summed across all options available on Nasdaq for a given announcement.6Wescalebuysandsellsby100toaccountforthefactthatanoptioncontract consists of 100 options, each corresponding to one share of the underlying. We do not weight options by maturity or moneyness for simplicity.7Throughout, we denote changes in this variable between t1andt2as\u2206Trader Position t1,t2, which captures net trader buying from market close at t1to market close at t2. To measure each clientele\u2019s exposure to changes in option prices, we cumulate these changes in net option positions to arrive at the net option position for each clientele group: Trader Position t=t \u2211 s=t\u2206Trader Position s, (2) where trepresents the first day that a given option appears in our sample. Although both these variables vary at the firm-quarter-day level, we drop firm-quarter subscripts for simplicity and focus on t, which refers to the day on which we measure po- sitions relative to the earnings announcement at t=0. To capture the option demand of retail investors that is specific to earnings announcements, in the remainder of the paper we calculate our measures of trader positions in (1) and (2) across all options that expire at least 10 days after the earnings announcement.8 As a benchmark, we also consider retail trade in the stock market in some of our analyses. To do so, we construct measures of the amount of retail buying and selling in the underlying stock. Using TAQ data, we identify retail marketable trades following Boehmer et al. (2021). 6Throughout our analysis, we aggregate opening buys, closing buys, opening sells, and closing sells of the same option contract across NOM and PHLX. 7In untabulated results, we find that our inferences are unchanged when delta-weighting positions as in Lakonishok et al. (2007). 8We do this to avoid potential measurement issues around option expiration, as our data does not contain information on option positions closed due to expiration. 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165We then calculate the total number of shares bought and sold by retail investors in the underlyingstockonday t, whichwedenotebyRetail Equity BuysitandRetail Equity Sellsit, respectively. 2.3 Descriptive Results on Pre-Announcement on Trading Activity In this section, we provide three descriptive results on option market trading activity by clientele groups that motivate our subsequent analyses of retail options trading around earnings announcements. Panel B of Figure 1 shows our first result: the extent of retail trading activity in option markets has increased markedly over time. Retail dollar option trading increased over ten-fold from approximately $20 billion in 2010 to approximately $240 billion in 2020.",

        "content": "Given our sample coverage has remained relatively constant over time, this finding is consistent with discussion in the mainstream press that infers a recent increase in retail options trading from the increasing number of small-lot traders.9The rise in retail option volume tracks the rise in overall market volume while also underscoring the growth in capital invested by retail customers, particularly in recent years coinciding with the COVID pandemic. Figure 2 illustrates our second descriptive result: option trading activity is heavily con- centrated around earnings announcements. In Panel A, we plot the average option dollar trading volume across all announcements in our sample at different trading days relative to the earnings announcement day, t=0. The results show a steep rise in overall option market trading concentrated around firms\u2019 earnings announcement dates. Trading volume spikes to two- or three-times normal levels in the days immediately surrounding the announcement. Panel B also shows the amount of pre-announcement option trading, defined over t=\u22125to t=\u22122, has increased markedly in recent years for all clientele groups. Our final motivating descriptive result is that retail investors and market makers are the most active clientele groups around earnings announcements. We illustrate this in Figure 3 9Seehttps://www.ft.com/content/b330e091-2a59-4527-b958-9213731a526c for an example. 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165by plotting our the average change in each clientele group\u2019s position in (1) relative to the earnings announcement day, t=0. Panel A shows retail traders tend to open option positions in the days prior to EAs, which are primarily absorbed by market makers. In contrast, Panel B shows the activity of professional customers, broker/dealers, and firms is relatively minor. Consequently, market makers are the primary bearers of the inventory risk posed by the announcement-specific option demand of retail investors. This role of market makers as liquidity providers and option writers is central to the mechanism through which we later argue retail demand impacts option prices. In Table 1, we provide summary statistics on our measures of trader positions in (1) and (2). Panel A shows the retail clientele group buys an average of 5,045 options between t=\u22125andt=\u22122prior to earnings announcements, which are offset primarily by market makers, consistent with Figure 3. Panel B shows this difference in trading behavior generates heterogeneity in announcement exposure across clientele groups: retail investors tend to be net long, while market makers, firms, and broker/dealers tend to be net short. Both panels illustrate substantial variation in pre-announcement trading behavior across the announce- ments in our sample, which is the variation in option market activity we seek to understand in our main tests. Taken together, these results suggest that the bulk of options trading activity is con- centrated around earnings announcements and mostly occurs between retail investors and market makers. Given these findings, we center the timing of our subsequent analyses around earnings announcements and focus on the determinants and equilibrium consequences of re- tail investors\u2019 options demand. As an additional way to gauge the importance of retail option trade prior to EAs, we also compare the magnitude of their positions in options relative to those in the stock market. We compute the following two measures, where buys and sells are measured from days \u22125 to\u22122relative to each EA: 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165Unsigned OS Ratioit=100\u00d7\u2211 o\u2223\u2206ito\u2223\u2217\u2206Retail Position ito Retail Equity Buysit+Retail Equity Sellsit; (3) OS Call Buy Ratioit=100\u00d7\u2211 o\u2208Calls\u2206ito\u2217(Retail Opening Buysito+Retail Opening Buysito) Retail Equity Buysit. (4) Intuitively, Unsigned OS Ratioitcapturestheamountofunsignedretailvolumeinoptions relative to stocks. We examine this metric as a simple way to compare the overall amount of retail trade in the two markets. On the other hand, OS Call Buy Ratioitfocuses on retail call purchases relative to stock purchases, placing them in comparable units by weighting call purchases by their respective option delta \u2206ito. This metric allows us to focus specifically on retail investors\u2019 purchasing behavior in options relative to stocks. We focus on call purchases because they can be directly compared to retails\u2019 purchases in the equity market, and in light of the evidence we will provide that retail focuses their purchases in calls (see Panel A of Table 4).",

        "content": "However, we obtain similar results when applying alternative means to comparing retail activity in stocks vs. options, such as netting purchases against sales or considering retail\u2019s positions across both calls and puts. Figure 4 plots these two metrics around EAs. It shows that both metrics spike just prior to and then drop soon after EAs. This indicates that, not only are retail traders trading more in options prior to EAs, but their trading behavior shifts across markets from stock to options. This shift suggests that the forces that drive retail option purchases prior to EAs are either considerably stronger than and/or distinct from those that drive retail stock purchases. Moreover, it indicates that existing theories on what drives retail trade in the stock market may not be able to fully explain retail trader behavior in options prior to EAs. 14 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=40501653 Pre-Announcement Retail Demand 3.1 Expected Announcement Volatility and Retail Demand Our first main result is that retail option purchases concentrate ahead of announce- ments with high expected volatility, which we abbreviate with EAV (expected announcement volatility). Our primary proxy for EAV relies on the market prices of options to back out these expectations. This metric uses the difference between the level of volatility implied by short- and long-horizon options and is defined as: AbnormalIV t=IVt,30\u2212IVt,60 1 30\u22121 60, (5) where IVt,\u03c4is the Black-Scholes implied volatility from the OptionMetrics Standardized Op- tion Price Files of an option with \u03c4days to maturity at tandtis measured in event-time with respect to earnings announcements. Intuitively, when investors expect earnings to cre- ate greater return variation, the short-term implied variance rises relative to the long-term implied variance because the event reflects a greater proportion of a short-term option\u2019s remaining lifetime (Smith and So 2020). Formally, if stock prices follow a log-normal diffu- sion process with log-normal jumps at t=0,AbnormalIV tmeasures precisely the expected squared jump on the EA date under the risk-neutral measure (Dubinsky et al. 2019). Because AbnormalIV tis derived from the market prices of options, retail demand may be mechanically associated with AbnormalIV tthrough market clearing. As Ni, Pan, and Poteshman (2008) show, demand for options has price impact prior to EAs, suggesting retail demand likely raises short-term implied volatility due to short-term options having a higher gamma and thus posing more unhedgeable risk for market makers. This greater price impact may influence AbnormalIV t, which introduces concerns about reverse causality. To mitigate these concerns, we exploit the fact that, as shown in Figure 3, retail trades are most prominent starting 3 days prior to the EA and examine AbnormalIV measured 5 days prior to the announcement, denoted as AbnormalIV \u22125. By design, AbnormalIV \u22125is measured 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165prior to the window over which we measure retail investors\u2019 pre-announcement trading. Figure5plotsaveragepre-announcementchangesineachclientelegroup\u2019spositionsacross quintiles of AbnormalIV \u22125in Panel A and the corresponding levels of their positions in Panel B. The results in Panel A show that pre-announcement retail trading from t=\u22125tot=\u22122 monotonicallyincreaseswith AbnormalIV \u22125andreflectsbuyingbehaviorinallbutthelowest quintile. We also see in Panel A that market makers are net sellers of options in all quintiles, consistent with their role in writing options. Firms are the only other clientele that tends to buy options ahead of high EAV announcements, but this buying behavior is low relative to their buying in the low EAV quintiles (unlike that of retail investors). Panel B of Figure 5 focuses on the level of each clientele\u2019s pre-announcement positions, rather than changes. The results show that the level of retail positions also increases mono- tonically across quintiles of AbnormalIV \u22125. Retail investors are actually net short options in the bottom quintile. This result may be initially surprising, but it is consistent with the evidence in Lakonishok et al. (2007) that the average non-market-maker position is nega- tive. Anecdotally, these short positions appear consistent with the use of cash covered puts and covered calls to generate income on positions in cash or the underlying.10Panel B also shows that retail is the only clientele group with statistically significant net long positions immediately prior to high EAV announcements.",

Economically, the coefficient on AbnormalIV \u22125in column (3) indicates that a one standard deviation increase in AbnormalIV \u22125translates into roughly 2,300 more options bought by retail investors immediately prior to the announcement.11Moreover, as shown in Panel B, thisincreaseinretailinvestors\u2019positionsismostlydrivenbyretailinvestorsopeningnewlong 10See, for example, descriptions on Charles Schwab, Fidelity, or Robinhood. 11In our Internet Appendix, we show the probability of retail buying also increases monotonically with EAV.

Panel C of Figure 5 plots coefficients similar to column (5) of Panel A in Table 2 for each year in our sample window, where each regression coefficient is scaled by the average absolute pre-announcement retail position change in each year.13The annual coefficients show that retail investor demands have become increasingly sensitive to variation in EAV. Retail investor sensitivity to EAV peaks in recent years coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic and the secular rise in retail participation in options. To verify that these results are not mechanically driven by the impact of retail demand on prices, columns (2) and (4) of Table 2 incorporate an additional proxy for EAV: the largest absolutereturnatanEAinpast5years, whichwerefertoas MAX EA. Thisproxyisfounded upon the notion that traders and the media may base their expectations of the significance of the announcement on the price movements surrounding past EAs \u2013 and hence price behavior around past announcements drives attention at future announcement dates. We compute the maximum EA return to capture anticipated volatility (as opposed to, e.g., historical volatility around EAs) following Bali et al. (2011), who examine an analogous metric in the equity market (the maximum stock return in the past month) and provide empirical support for the notion that investor beliefs about future returns are strongly influenced by the extremes, as opposed to the average, of past outcomes. 12Our Internet Appendix shows the relation between EAV and retail investors\u2019 option buying occurs on the the intensive margin, where retail shifts their options positions away from lower to high EAV announcements. This suggests retail investors do not appear offset their positions in high EAV announcements by holding diversifying positions in other options. 13This scaling is done to address the fact that retail trading volume has increased over time. The upward trend in the plot is robust to various scaling choices. 17 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=40501653.2 The Role of Retail Investor Attention WenextturntostudyingthemechanismthatdrivesthestrongrelationbetweenEAVand retail option demand. In this section, we provide evidence supporting the role of attention- based theories in explaining this pattern in retail option demand. Prior research emphasizes the role of media coverage in capturing retail investors\u2019 atten- tion and subsequently affecting their trading decisions (e.g., Barber and Odean 2008; Da, Engelberg, and Gao 2011; Barber et al. 2021). Motivated by this evidence, Panel A of Ta- ble 3 examines the relation between EAV and media coverage. We capture news coverage using the number of news articles published in the WSJ, Washington Post, USA Today, and New York Times, as in Niessner and So (2018). The results show that both of our proxies for EAV are associated with higher news coverage pre-announcement, in addition to coverage during and after the earnings announcement. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in EAV coincides with an increase in the number of news articles published by 22% during t\u2208[\u22125,\u22122], 20% during t\u2208[1,1], and 16% during t\u2208[2,5]. This finding is consistent with priorevidencethatannouncementswithnovelinformationattractmoremediacoverage(e.g., Noh et al. 2021). The heightened news coverage prior to high EAV announcements documented in Panel A likely increases their salience in the minds of retail investors.",

In Panel B of Table 3, we show this increased media coverage indeed plays a crucial role in shaping the relation between EAV and the trading behavior of retail investors. The results in columns (1) and (2) show the relation between EAV and retail investor demand increases by a factor of around four for a one-standard deviation increase in news coverage. Columns (3) and (4) further emphasize this: the amount of buying in top quintile high EAV announce- ments is an order of magnitude larger in the subsample of announcements with positive 18 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165pre-announcement media coverage. Collectively, these findings suggest that retail investor attention, spurred through media coverage, contributes strongly to their pre-announcement option demand. These findings complement a substantial literature that highlights retail investors respond to the realization of attention-grabbing news, by highlighting that retail buying is also driven by the anticipation of attention-grabbing news. 3.3 Alternative Mechanisms for the Link between EAV and Retail Demand Our results thus far support an attention-based explanation for the relation between EAV and retail investor option demands. In this section, we consider two alternative classes of explanations: (i) preference-based explanations, in which retail investors prefer trading options around higher EAV announcements because they find the payoff profile attractive, and (ii) a rational use of options to hedge against or to speculate on information regarding the volatility of future returns. We begin by considering the first category: preference-based explanations. Two popular theories of investor preferences in behavioral finance are prospect theory (Barberis, Huang, and Santos 2005) and theories of motivated reasoning (Brunnermeier and Parker 2005), both of which generate a preference for positively-skewed (i.e, lottery-like) payoffs. These theories are supported by empirical evidence showing that retail investors exhibit this preference in equity markets (see e.g., Han and Kumar (2013)). Given option return skewness might conceivably rise prior to high EAV announcements, this mechanism could in principle also explain our results. Several facts suggest that our results are not fully explained by a preference for skew- ness. First, Boyer and Vorkink (2014) demonstrate that option return skewness strongly declines in implied volatility for OTM options and is close to constant in implied volatility for ITM options (see their Figure 2), suggesting option skewness is lower around high EAV announcements. Secondly, Panel A of Table 4 shows pre-announcement option purchases by retail investors concentrate in at-the-money call options. Finally, Panel B shows that retail 19 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165demand is roughly evenly distributed across options with less than one month and more than two months to maturity. Because at-the-money and relatively long-dated options have the largest volatility exposure but significantly less exposure to skewness, these results suggest our findings are not likely to be driven by a preference for lottery-like payoffs. An alternative preference-based explanation for why EAV is positively related to retail option demand is that retail investors exhibit a preference for volatility. In models of realiza- tion utility, this preference arises because the ability to immediately realize gains and delay losses generates option-like payoffs to investing in an asset, resulting in a value function that increases in the volatility of the underlying asset (Barberis and Xiong 2012; Ingersoll and Jin 2013). A testable implication of this theory is that retail investors should buy more longer-dated options, as they allow for longer delaying of losses. We find some evidence of retail investors buying longer-dated options in Panel B of Table 4. Although this explanation alone cannot explain the importance of news documented in the prior section, we view our findings as providing evidence consistent with theories of realization utility, though a specific focus on the role played by realization utility is beyond the scope of the paper. Movingtothesecondcategoryofalternativeexplanations,inrationalmodelsoftradethat feature derivatives, these derivatives can be used either (i) to hedge the risk exposure, such as variance risk or directional stock exposure that results from positions in the underlying stock, and (ii) to speculate on private information regarding the future return variance (e.g.",

        "content": "Leland 1980; Buraschi and Jiltsov 2006; Smith 2019). We next provide evidence that these motives are unlikely to explain the link between EAV and retail option demand. The reason that purchasing options is useful for hedging in these models is that they protect investors\u2019 equity positions against extreme moves in the stock price. Put options hedge the tail risk associated with long positions, while call options hedge the tail risk associated with short positions in the underlying stock. Thus, given retail investors are more likely to be long rather than short the stock due to short-sale constraints, if they used options for hedging, we would expect them to purchase put options. However, Panel A in Table 4 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165shows that the link between EAV and retail demand concentrates in call options rather than put options. A second piece of evidence that casts doubt on retail investors using options to hedge is Panel C of Table 4, which shows that EAV is negatively associated with the holdings of other groups of traders as these traders absorb the spike in retail demand. The fact that the positive relation between EAV and clienteles\u2019 net positions is absent for professional customers,firms,andbroker-dealerssuggestsretailinvestorsarecontrarianandhavedifferent motivations to trade than other clientele groups. In contrast, if retail investors were using optionstohedge,wewouldexpectsimilartradingbehavioramongalternativeclientelegroups (e.g. professional customers), who likely have correlated prices of risk. Although retail investors do not appear to be using options to hedge prior to high EAV announcements, they could be rationally using them to speculate based on private informa- tion. Indeed, past evidence lends some credibility to the notion that retail purchases may reflect rational trade on private information regarding volatility in options. For example, Ni et al. (2008) show that total option demand by non-market-makers (which includes retail investors) predicts future stock return volatility, which they attribute to informed volatil- ity trading. Additionally, Kaniel et al. (2012) shows that retail trade in the stock market appears to be informed prior to earnings announcements. However, for this to explain why retail traders systematically purchase options prior to high EAV announcements, these op- tions would have to be, on average, under-priced by market makers, and retail traders would have to recognize this. At face value, this appears unlikely given the relative sophistication of these two investor groups. Moreover, in later tests, we provide evidence that this is unlikely the case, as options earn significantly negative returns following high EAV announcements. 3.4 EAV and Retail Trade in Options Relative to Stocks We next illustrate that, as EAV rises, retail\u2019s activity in the option market prior to earn- ings announcements grows not only on an absolute basis, but also relative to their activity 21 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165in the stock market. To demonstrate this, we again apply the measures of relative trade in stock versions options, Unsigned OS Ratioitand OS Call Buy Ratioit, that we defined in (3) and (4). In Table 5, we regress these measures onto our metrics of EAV. Across both of our measures of EAV, we find that retail\u2019s overall activity and purchasing activity increase in the option relative to the stock market. This shift in retail trade from the stock to the option market further distinguishes our results from the existing literature showing attention-grabbing events induce retail traders to purchase stocks (e.g., Barber and Odean 2008). While this literature links historical volatility to retail stock purchases, the evidence in Table 5 suggests that the anticipation of futurevolatility drives these traders to take option positions. Among the explanations we consider for retails\u2019 option purchasing, this evidence is most consistent with retail traders exhibiting a preference for volatility. The reason is that the embedded leverage in options greatly amplifies the volatility exposure they provide relative to stocks. Furthermore, while attention can explain why retail would purchase securities in both the stock and option markets prior to high EAV announcements, it cannot explain why retail traders would take larger positions in options. 3.5 Pre-Announcement Retail Price Pressure Existing evidence on retail trading in equity markets has found retail investors can be contrarian, trading in opposite directions as other traders (e.g., Kaniel et al. 2012).",

        "content": "Our evidence in the prior section suggests a similar pattern holds in option markets. However, this literature in equity markets also emphasizes that retail traders earn a premium from supplying liquidity, which in turn enhances market stability (e.g., Barrot et al. 2016). In this section, we provide evidence suggesting this latter result does not extend to options market (as in Foucault et al. 2011). To provide evidence that retail investors demand, rather than supply, liquidity prior to high EAV announcements, we next study their impact on option prices. We base our 22 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165predictions on the demand-based option pricing theory from Garleanu et al. (2009). In the presence of market incompleteness that prevents perfect replication of options using the underlying stock, this theory predicts demand from end-users (i.e. retail investors in our setting) that must be fulfilled by market makers will directly impact option prices. According to this theory, the size of end-users\u2019 price impact increases with the difficulty marketmakersfaceinhedgingtheoption. Asaresult, thistheorypredictsthatretailtraders\u2019 purchases should have potent price impact leading up to earnings announcements. Retail investors form their option positions primarily by trading with market makers, which causes marketmakerstoalsoholdconcentratedpositionsandthusbearinventoryrisksthroughhigh EAV earnings announcements. Moreover, these announcements lead to discrete changes in the underlying stock prices (Lee and Mykland 2008). These jumps make it impossible for marketmakerstofullyhedgetheiroptionexposureusingtheunderlyingstock,forcingmarket makers to take on heightened risk when holding options through these announcements. To assess retail\u2019s impact on option prices pre-announcement, we examine the relation between retail buying during t\u2208[\u22125,\u22122]andAbnormalIV \u22121, controlling for AbnormalIV \u22125. The logic of this approach is as follows. Recall AbnormalIV \u22125captures the expected abnor- mal return variance on the announcement date calculated using option prices 5 days before the announcement, i.e., prior to when retail traders tend to enter the market. Absent de- mandeffects, AbnormalIV twould, onaverage, remainconstantfromday \u22125today\u22122, asthe amount of volatility expected on the announcement date should not systematically change over time. Thus, an on-average change in AbnormalIV tover these days should capture the price impact of investor demand.14Formally, this approach relies on the following identify- ing assumption: shocks to retail demand during t\u2208[\u22125,\u22122]that are independent of option 14Note this approach has two advantages relative to examining, e.g., option returns. First, it places options across announcements, which vary in moneyness and maturities, in common units \u2013 implied variances \u2013 rendering their price changes comparable. Second, since AbnormalIV tis calculated as the (weighted) difference in the implied variances of short- and long-term options, it essentially controls for changes in the prices of long-term options. This helps to isolate retail price impact from any news regarding post- announcement diffusive volatility that arrives during days [\u22125,\u22122], since such news will affect the implied variances of both short- and long-term options. 23 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165prices are orthogonal to price-independent demand shocks of other investors. We view this as a reasonable assumption given that retail investors demands are primarily absorbed by market makers, who are mostly passive providers of liquidity (as in the model of Garleanu et al. 2009). OurresultsinTable6suggestretaildemandindeedhasalargeimpactonoptionprices, as it is positively associated with AbnormalIV \u22121controlling for AbnormalIV \u22125. Economically, our estimates imply that option prices are around 40% higher in terms of implied variances at t=\u22121for an announcement with top-quintile retail buying relative to another announcement with no retail buying but identical EAV (measured using AbnormalIV \u22125). As a result, it appears that equilibrium prices adjust in response to the demand pressure from retail investors in order to compensate market makers for holding these positions through high EAV announcements. 4 Three Factors that Influence Retail Investment Performance Overthenexttwosectionsofourpaper, weconducttwosetsofteststhatjointlyillustrate howretail\u2019sproclivitytowardspurchasingoptionspriortohighEAVannouncementsdepletes their wealth. In Section 4, we provide evidence on three factors contributing to the dynamics of retail investor performance around earnings announcements. In Section 5, we take an aggregate approach that tracks retail positions in event-time to directly quantify how these factors combine to impact retail wealth. 4.1 EAV and Post-Announcement Option Returns Our results in Table 6 suggest retail traders may be reducing price efficiency when trading prior to announcements by inflating prices. However, past evidence shows that retail traders earn positive trading profits in equity markets around earnings announcements (e.g., Kaniel et al. 2012; Kelley and Tetlock 2013).",

In this case, their price impact would bring the implied variance closer to the actual level of this variance, raising price efficiency. If this were the case, we would expect to see that options earn non- negative returns following high EAV announcements. Alternatively, retail traders may purchase options prior to high EAV announcements for behavioral reasons, such as the attention-based explanation for which we provide support in Section 3.2. In this case, we would expect to see that options earn negative returns following high EAV announcements, for two non-exclusive reasons. First, if retail traders do not have private information on future volatility, the price pressure they create prior to these announcements will gradually reverse after they establish their positions, generating negative returns. The reason is that after the announcements, both the quantity of options held by market makers declines as retail investors close their positions andthe quantity of risk per option declines due to the resolution of uncertainty. Jointly, these patterns imply the total unhedgeable risk faced by market makers decreases post-announcement, which (in the model of Garleanu et al. 2009) implies a correction in option prices. The second reason options could earn negative returns in the event that retail investors do not have private information is that the market may have incorrect expectations with respect to the magnitude of the price moves certain announcements will create. In this case, when sorting announcements on EAV, short-term options in the upper quintiles are more likely to be those where the market has overshot the true announcement volatility. Hence, these options will have negative expected returns. The evidence in Goyal and Saretto (2009) that the implied volatility premium negatively forecasts option returns provides support for this possibility. To provide insight into the impact that retail option trade has on price efficiency and to motivate our subsequent analysis of how this trade impacts retail\u2019s wealth, we next examine the relation between EAV and post-announcement option returns. To be precise, we examine the predictive power of two measures: (i) AbnormalIV \u22125, which captures EAV alone, and (ii) 25 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165AbnormalIV \u22121, which captures the combination of EAV and the price pressure that retail traders create: AbnormalIV \u22121=AbnormalIV

retail price pressure. For each announcement, we select one straddle by choosing a call and put pair of the same strike and maturity. We choose the closest-to-the-money pair, defined based on the ratio of the forward to strike price, among all pairs that expire most closely after 13 days past the earnings announcement. We select 13 days in order to study returns over the two weeks following the announcement date and add an additional 3 days to mitigate concerns about microstructure effects near expiration (Carr and Wu 2009). We then compute the returns to sellinga straddle at time tas SRET t=\u22121\u2217[Call Price t+Put Price t\u2212Call Price t\u22121\u2212Put Price t\u22121 Call Price t\u22121+Put Price t\u22121],(6) where Call Price tand Put Price tcorrespond to midpoints of the best bid and ask exchange quotes at market close on day tfrom OptionMetrics.15By looking at straddles, we isolate the pricing of volatility from any directional pricing effects in the underlying (e.g., Coval and Shumway 2001).16Additionally, we complement this approach by examining returns on the specific options in which retail transacts in Section 5. Panels A and B of Table 7 show results from quarterly portfolio sorts on AbnormalIV \u22121, using lagged quarterly breakpoints. We find straddles for high EAV announcements under- perform straddles for low EAV announcements by a whopping average return of 11% per announcement ( t-stat = 19.44) on the announcement day and an additional 9% ( t-stat = 15On days where quotes are missing in OptionMetrics, we assume the option price is unchanged. Duarte, Jones, and Wang (2019) highlight big microstructure biases in option prices, resulting in errors in returns to option strategies of 50bps per day.",

(2009) implies demand for calls impacts both the prices of both calls and puts (and thus straddles) because put-call parity holds. 26 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=40501658.31) over the 10 days after the announcement, with little skewness or kurtosis. This sub- stantial negative return on the announcement and the continuation post-announcement (i.e., the absence of a reversal) indicates that retail traders do not appear to have private infor- mation when purchasing options ahead of high EAV announcements. Instead, it suggests retail investors purchase options that are overpriced relative to realized volatility.17 In Panel C, we perform quarterly Fama-MacBeth regressions. To assess whether the post announcement returns in Panels A and B simply represent overpricing in high EAV an- nouncements or are driven in part by retail demand pressure, we compare the return predic- tive power of AbnormalIV \u22125andAbnormalIV \u22121. Columns (3) and (7) show AbnormalIV \u22125 is a strong predictor of announcement-day and post-announcement straddle returns, after controlling for other important option return predictors. However, columns (4) and (8) show AbnormalIV \u22121is a significantly more potent predictor of returns, as it absorbs the predictive power of AbnormalIV \u22125. Since the primary difference between these measures is thatAbnormalIV \u22121more accurately accounts for retail demand pressure, these results retail demand pressure has a non-trivial influence on option prices. Notably, the regressions in Panel C include several controls based on prior work on that explores the predictability of option returns. First, this work suggests that option returns may capture a premium for systematic variance risk (Leland 1980; Barth and So 2014; Smith 2019). We thus continue to control for the proxies for this risk on the earnings date that we applied in the previous section. Second, we again control for the measure of the lotteryness of an option\u2019s payoff from Boyer and Vorkink (2014), calculated for the straddles under consideration. Looking across the columns in Panel A, we see that adding controls strengthens the relation between EAV and straddle returns, further highlighting how a preference for skewness or hedging demand cannot entirely explain our results and thus should be seen as complementary drivers of option prices.18 17InourInternetAppendix,weshowthisreturnpredictabilityisnotpresentaroundpseudo-announcements and generalizes to all earnings announcements in OptionMetrics outside of those in our Nasdaq sample. 18In our Internet Appendix, we show our return predictability is independent of option liquidity and is complementary to that documented by Boyer and Vorkink (2014). 27 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=40501654.2 Pre-Announcement Transaction Costs A second factor that impacts retail investor performance is the large bid-ask spreads they incur when opening their positions. This result is driven by the fact that single-name equity options in general have high bid-ask spreads (Muravyev and Pearson 2020), but also because these spreads are abnormally large prior to high EAV announcements. To illustrate this result, we approximate the bid-ask spread retail investors incur when buying options between t=\u22125andt=\u22122, as in Table 2. Throughout, we make conservative assumptions about these transaction costs to ensure we have a lower bound on their impor- tance. In particular, we assume such an investor holds the option to maturity, implying the investor only incurs half of the bid-ask spread (the \u201chalf-spread\u201d). Let Half-Spreadiqotdenote the half-spread (in % of midpoint) from OptionMetrics for an option owritten on firm ion event-day trelative to the earnings announcement in quarter q. We compute our estimate of the half-spread incurred by retail investors by buying options before firm i\u2019s announcement in quarter qas the following weighted average: Half-Spread Incurred by Retailiq=\u2211 o\u03c91 iqo\u22122 \u2211 t=\u22125\u03c92 iqotHalf-Spreadiqot, (7) where the outer summation occurs over all available options oin our sample and the weights (which both sum to one) in the summation are: \u03c91 iqo=\u2223Retail Position iqo\u22121\u2223 \u2211o\u2223Retail Position iqo\u22121\u2223, \u03c92 iqot=\u2223\u2206Retail Position iqot\u2223 \u2211\u22122 t=5\u2223\u2206Retail Position iqot\u2223.",

By weighting the half-spread on a particular option based on the amount retail trades on a given day, \u03c91 iqot, our calculation gives greater weight to days on which retail investors trade more. The weights when summing across 28 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165options, \u03c92 iqo, give larger weight to options in which retail has more exposure. Figure 6 illustrates the spreads that retail face and how these spreads vary with EAV, measured using AbnormalIV \u22121. Panel A shows retail investors pay a large amount of trans- action costs in dollars prior to all announcements, but that these costs are close to 50% greater prior to high than low EAV announcements. In Panel B, we examine the transaction costs incurred by retail investors in percentage of the midpoint. This panel demonstrates that the typical percentage half spreads that retail traders incur are on the order of 8%. Collectively, both panels demonstrate that spreads prior to announcements increase with top-quintile EAV to roughly 9%, which compounds the losses retail investors face. 4.3 Holding onto Positions Post-Announcement The third factor we document that influences the loss of wealth by retail investors around high EAV announcements is their tendency to hold on to the option positions they open prior tohighEAVannouncements. InTable8, weexaminetheextenttowhichpost-announcement retail positions one week after the announcement are predictable using our measures of EAV. Columns (1) and (4) in Panel A show that retail traders continue to hold on to the positions one week after the announcement, on t=5, that they opened prior to high EAV announcements. Given the evidence in Table 7 that options continue to earn large negative expected returns over the two weeks following high EAV announcements, this behavior is likely to further deplete retail investors\u2019 wealth. A natural explanation for this finding is that retail investors hold on to options to hedge against large stock prices moves that might follow high AbnormalIV \u22121announcements. This explanation is unlikely valid for two reasons. First, in Figure 7, we plot the average event- time idiosyncratic volatility in top and bottom quintiles of EAV in Panel A and the difference between the two in Panel B. Figure 7 shows there is no meaningful difference in idiosyncratic volatility between high and low EAV announcements aside from on the announcement day. This finding suggests it is unlikely that retail investors continue to hold their positions to 29 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165hedge, as the quantity of this risk does not appear to differ across low and high EAV an- nouncements. Secondly, Panel B of Table 8 shows other traders behave differently from retail investors post-announcement. A notable finding is the reduction in positions from firms, who also buy options pre-announcement (Figure 5). This suggests that hedging motives, such as a desire to hedge the incorporation of earnings news post-announcement, are unlikely to drive the sustained post-announcement demand of retail investors. An alternative explanation for this finding is that it reflects portfolio inertia, similar to that documented in retail investors\u2019 equity portfolio choices (e.g., Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini 2009; Choukhmane and de Silva 2022). However, this explanation is unlikely in our setting given retail investors appear to intentionally open these options prior to earnings with the goal of being exposed to the earnings price move. Additionally, the large negative average return to being long volatility as documented in Table 7 is difficult to reconcile with reasonably-sized portfolio adjustment costs. We hypothesize two remaining forces that could drive retail investors\u2019 persistent option holdings. First, retail traders may hold option positions to maturity in order to avoid the transaction costs (i.e., bid-ask spread) associated with closing out these positions. Second, given the negative returns to straddles around high EAV announcements documented in the previous section, retail traders lose on average around these announcements.",

        "content": "In the presence of such losses, retail investors may fail to sell due to a disposition effect, which could occur due to convexity of investors\u2019 value functions in the loss domain (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Barber and Odean 2008) or the negative realization utility from selling (Barberis and Xiong 2012; Ingersoll and Jin 2013). In the remaining columns of Table 8 Panel A, we empirically explore these two potential explanations. Beginning with the disposition effect, we examine how retail traders\u2019 P&L on the announcement date influences their proclivity to hold onto their option positions. We adoptananalogousapproachtoGenesoveandMayer(2001)andexamineretailtraders\u2019losses att=0, defined as max(0,\u2212Retail P&L 0)where Retail P&L 0is calculated by aggregating 30 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165the product of Retail\u2019s position in each option at t=\u22121multiplied by the change in each option price from t=\u22121tot=0. To test for the disposition effect, we focus on the interaction between max(0,\u2212Retail P&L 0)and our metrics of EAV. This interaction captures whether retail investors are more likely to continue holding option positions following high EAV announcements when these announcements subject them to large losses. Consistent with the disposition effect driving retail traders\u2019 proclivity to maintain their option positions, we find that they hold on to a greater proportion of their options around high EAV announcements when they experience losses on the announcement date. Quanti- tatively, columns (2) and (5) of Panel A show that a one standard deviation increase in the losses experienced by retail investors doubles the relation between EAV and retail investors\u2019 post-announcement positions. Columns (3) and (6) show retail investors appear to respond to transaction costs, but notably this response is about one-fifth as large as their response to prior losses. In sum, these results suggest the post-announcement trading behavior of retail investors appears to be primarily influenced by a disposition effect, even after controlling for the effect of transaction costs, consistent with behavioral motives driving their trading decisions. 5 Tracking Wealth Dynamics around Earnings Announcements Our final tests take an aggregated approach that leverages the granularity of our data to more directly track wealth dynamics in event-time relative to earnings announcements. As a complement to our straddle return tests, these tests provide a more precise picture of the wealth dynamics of retail investors after accounting for their concentrated positions in options ahead of high EAV announcements as well as conservative assumptions about the transaction costs they incur. 31 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=40501655.1 Approximating Trader Profit and Loss In Appendix B, we show that the P&L of each trader on day, t, summed across options, i, can be approximated as follows: Trader P&L t\u2248\u2211 iTrader Position it\u22121\u2217(Option Priceit\u2212Option Priceit\u22121). (8) Calculating the P&L of each clientele group using (8) requires three key assumptions. First, it requires that we observe all of the options positions of each trader. Since this assumption clearly fails as traders trade options on other exchanges than Nasdaq, we choose to scale the P&L of each trader by the average dollar trading volume on Nasdaq one month before the announcement. By estimating P&L as a multiple of observed trading volume, we hope to take into account variation in Nasdaq sample coverage that would pollute an unnormalized measure in dollars. Second, when implementing (8) empirically, we use the last traded price of each option from Nasdaq. Thus, we make the assumption that all traders rebalance at market close, as we do not observe intra-day trading in our data.19 The final simplifying assumption needed for (8) is that there are no bid-ask spreads. By ignoring bid-ask spreads in this initial calculation, (8) under-estimates the P&L to mar- ket makers and over-estimates of the P&L to other traders. In Section 5.3, we relax this assumption and consider varying levels of transaction costs. 5.2 Trader Profitability across Announcements In Panel A of Figure 8, we plot the average P&L of each clientele group between market close on t=\u22121and market close at t=10, the same time period over which we examine straddle returns, across five quintiles of our measure of EAV, AbnormalIV \u22121. The results show retail investors\u2019 P&L decreases monotonically across the quintiles of EAV, with re- tail investors losing a statistically significant amount in the highest EAV announcements.",

Given the average non-EA dollar volume in our sample is $134K, this implies an on average loss of approximately $6K per announcement and approximately $60K per top quintile EAV announcement. Aggregating across approximately 6,000 high EAV announcements in our sample, the latter estimate implies a total $360M wealth transfer in our sample. Under the assumption that a similar wealth transfer occurs across all traded options, our sample\u2019s \u223c25% coverage of total option activity implies a $1.5 billion wealth transfer away from retail investors in options markets over our sample period before accounting for spreads. Panel A also shows the majority of capital flows away from retail investors goes to market makers, as transfers to the remaining clientele appear indistinguishable from zero. Given this calculation ignores bid-ask spreads, we expect the actual wealth transfer to be considerably larger, as market makers receive the spread as additional compensation. In our Internet Appendix, we replicate the same analysis around pseudo-earnings announcements and find these wealth transfers we document appear specific to earnings announcements. We next estimate the investment returns of retail investors by calculating three variables. First, we calculate daily returns of retail\u2019s long positions by calculating their P&L according to(8)summingonlyacrosslongpositions. Wethendividethisbythenetlongdollarexposure of retail to measure long option returns, Retail Avg. ReturnLong t. Second, we calculate the daily returns of retail\u2019s short positions analogously, denoted by Retail Avg. ReturnShort t. Fi- nally, wecalculateaweightedaverageofthetwobasedonthedollarexposureofretailonlong and short positions for each announcement at t=\u22121, denoted by Retail Avg. ReturnWeighted t. Table 9 estimates how much lower these returns are for top-quintile EAV announcements. The first two columns show that retail investors lose an average of 250 basis points (bps) per day on their long positions over the announcement day and 10 days following the announce- ment, while they lose around 55-70bps more on high EAV announcements. In contrast, retail investors make on average 180bps on their short positions over the same time period, but 33 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165gain around 40bps more on their short positions around high EAV announcements. Columns (5) and (6) of Table 9 examine how retail investors\u2019 weighted return varies across announcements. We find retail investors earn a small average return of around 6bps (not accounting for transaction costs) around lower EAV announcements. However, around high EAV announcements, we estimate that retail investors lose roughly 60bps per day over the 11 days beginning with the announcement date. Cumulating these returns over these 11 days results in our final estimate that retail investors lose around 7% on average of their options investments around high EAV earnings announcements. These losses are an order of magnitude larger than the losses that Bauer et al. (2009) show retail investors in the Netherlands incur trading options on the typical day, which amount to 181 basis points per month . This is consistent with retail investors buying options that are exceptionally overpriced around high EAV announcements. 5.3 Incorporating Transaction Costs We next quantify how the large spreads incurred by retail, as documented in Section 4.2, influence their returns and the amount of wealth they yield to market makers. Figure 8 Panel B shows how the variation in Retail P&L across quintiles of EAV varies after we take into account transaction costs. We convert our estimate of the half-spread in (7) into dollars by multiplying by \u2223Retail Position \u22121\u2223and then subtract it from our estimate of Retail\u2019s P&L in (8) to produce these estimates. In the figure, we show how our estimates vary based on the assumptions we make about the price-improvement that retail investors receive relative to the best quoted half-spread (a price improvement of 100% would give identical results to Panel A of Figure 8). As evident from Panel B, for all values of possible price improvement we consider, retail investorslosesignificantlymorewealthduetotransactioncosts.",

        "content": "Assumingthatretailtraders receive price improvement of 20% is conservative, particularly in light of evidence in Ernst and Spatt (2022) that retail price improvement hovers around 10%. Under this assumption, 34 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165we estimate the average loss for announcements in the top quintile of EAV doubles relative to Panel A. Applying the simple aggregation calculation from the previous section, this translates into a wealth loss by retail investors of around $3 billion over our sample. In Panel C, we show how incorporating transaction costs affects our estimates of retail\u2019s cumulative returns from t=0tot=10under the assumption of 20% price improvement. Comparing the results with Table 9 highlights two effects of transaction costs. First, trans- action costs contribute to retail investors now losing wealth in all quintiles: a cumulative 6%lossover 11 days in the bottom four quintiles, in contrast to the 1% gainimplied by the 9bps average daily return column (6) of Table 9. Thus, any gains retail traders make from the premium they receive by selling options are eroded by transaction costs. A second key insight of Figure 8 is transaction costs compound retail investors\u2019 losses around high EAV announcements: in Panel C the cumulative negative loss is around 12% compared to the approximate 7% loss estimated in column (6) of Table 9. Moreover, as shown in Figure 9, more than half of this -12% return occurs on the announcement day alone. Finally, following the announcement, after again assuming 20% price improvement, Figure 9 also shows that transaction costs result in retail losing an additional \u223c5% over the 10-day post-announcement window. 6 Conclusion The COVID pandemic coincided with a significant increase in retail investors participat- ing in options markets, and this behavior has led to concern among regulators. This study aims to offer important insights into how their behavior impacts prices, gains, and losses. We first show that retail investors are attracted to trading options around announcements with high expected volatility (EAV), likely due to their greater salience through news cov- erage. Second, these retail demands generate risk for market makers that are priced and hence generate return predictability on and following high EAV announcements. Finally, retail investors are slow to close their positions following losses on the announcement day as 35 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165option prices predictably decay. This combination of behaviors translates to retail losses of 5-to-9% around earnings an- nouncements on average, and 10-to-14% for high expected volatility announcements. This has led to significant capital transfers from retail investors to market makers, especially dur- ing the COVID pandemic. Our results complement the findings in Poteshman and Serbin (2003) that unsophisticated investors exercise options early by showing that not only do these investors misunderstand the mechanics of options, but also they trade these options at times when and in stocks where they have exceptionally high prices. 36 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165References Baker, Malcolm, Brendan Bradley, and Jeffrey Wurgler (2011), \u201cBenchmarks as limits to arbitrage: Understanding the low-volatility anomaly.\u201d Financial Analysts Journal , 67, 40\u2013 54.

Denote the portfolio value in dollars of a given trader\u2019s position on day tas Trader PV tand letidenote an option that the trader holds. By definition, Trader PV t=\u2211 iTrader Position it\u2217Option Priceit+Outside Wealth t, (9) whereTrader Position itcorrespondstothepositionofthetraderinoption iatt,Option Priceit denotes the price of option iatt, and the sum over iis across all options on all underlyings that the trader holds. Outside Wealth tdenotes other assets held in the traders\u2019 portfolio (e.g., the underlying stock), which we do not observe. Taking first differences of (9) and rearranging gives an expression for the trader P&L: Trader P&L t\u2261\u2206Trader PV t=\u2211 iTrader Position it\u22121\u2217(Option Priceit\u2212Option Priceit\u22121) +\u2211 iOption Priceit\u2217(Trader Position it\u2212Trader Position it\u22121) +\u2206Outside Wealth t. Since a trader\u2019s outside wealth is not observable, we assume that changes in outside wealth stem from using assets (e.g., cash) to buy options and receiving assets from selling options: \u2211 iOption Priceit\u2217(Trader Position it\u2212Trader Position it\u22121)=\u2212\u2206Outside Wealth t.(10) Under this assumption, we can calculate the P&L of each trader using (8). Calculating the P&L of each clientele group using (8) requires three additional assump- tions. First, it requires that we observe all of the options positions of each trader. Since the latter assumption clearly fails as traders trade options on other exchanges than Nasdaq, we choose to scale the P&L of each trader by the average dollar trading volume on Nasdaq one month before the announcement. By estimating P&L as a multiple of observed trad- 42 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4050165ing volume, we hope to take into account variation in Nasdaq sample coverage that would pollute an unnormalized measure in dollars. Second, when implementing (8) empirically, we use the last traded price of each option from Nasdaq. Thus, we make the assumption that all traders rebalance at market close, as we do not observe intra-day trading in our data. Finally, we ignore bid-ask spreads in this calculation, which will result in an understatement of the P&L to market makers and an overstatement of the P&L to other traders (we relax this assumption in subsection 4.2). Although these assumptions required for us to correctly estimate the level of trader P&L may appear restrictive, we emphasize our interest is pri- marily in how P&L varies across announcements and we see no reason for the validity of these assumptions to meaningfully vary with EAV.

Panel A of this figure plots the fraction of total volume and open interest in OptionMetrics that is covered in the Nasdaq data. For each option-day, we merge Nasdaq with OptionMetrics and calculate the ratio of Nasdaq to OptionMetrics trading volume and open interest. Panel A then plots the average of these ratios across every day in each year using all options available on Nasdaq. Panel B of this figure plots the total dollar trading volume of Retail for each year in our sample across all options available on Nasdaq.

The straddle for each announcement is chosen as the nearest-to-the-money straddle with the shortest maturity that expires at least 13 days after the announcement. In Panel A, firm- quarter observations are placed into quintiles each quarter, using quintile breakpoints from the prior quarter. We then calculate the returns for each portfolio in a given quarter by taking the equal-weighted average of SRET 0for all firm-quarters in that portfolio. The values displayed in the left half of each table are the time-series mean and t-statistics (in parenthesis) of the resulting quarterly returns. The values displayed in the right half of each table are the time-series skewness and excess kurtosis (in parenthesis) of the quarterly portfolio returns. Panel B performs the analogous analysis with SRET 1,10. Panel C displays the results from quarterly Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions with standard errors calculated from a frequency-domain heteroskedasticityandautocorrelationrobustequal-weightedcosineestimatorofthelong-runvariancematrix with the truncation rule suggested by Lazarus, Lewis, Stock, and Watson (2018).
